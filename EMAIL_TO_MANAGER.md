### Subject: Reddit Sentiment Project - Handoff & Ownership Transfer

### Body:

```
Hi Brian,

I wanted to give you a heads up about the Reddit Competitor Sentiment project 
and prepare for a smooth handoff in case I transition out of this role.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 CURRENT STATUS:

The project is fully operational and running smoothly:
✅ Automatically runs every Sunday at 8 PM EST
✅ Emails 5 stakeholders (you, Assaf, me, Adam K, Adam P)
✅ 100% success rate for the past 5 weeks
✅ Zero manual intervention needed

Live Dashboard: https://ktsering2025.github.io/reddit-competitor-sentiment/
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/ktsering2025/reddit-competitor-sentiment

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT IT DOES:

Every Sunday, the system:
1. Scrapes Reddit for posts about 8 meal kit brands
2. Analyzes sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
3. Generates charts and detailed reports
4. Emails everyone with insights and PDF attachment
5. Updates the live dashboard

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

Weekly (5 minutes every Monday):
• Check if you received Sunday's email
• Verify automation ran successfully
• That's it!

If automation fails (rare):
• Go to GitHub Actions
• Click "Run workflow" button
• Takes 30 seconds, no coding needed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔐 OWNERSHIP TRANSFER:

When you're ready, I can transfer the GitHub repository to you. This gives 
you full control over:
• GitHub Actions automation
• All credentials and secrets
• Code and documentation
• Ability to modify anything

I've created two guides for you:
1. MANAGER_QUICK_START.md - Everything you need (10 min read)
2. HANDOFF_GUIDE.md - Complete handoff process (20 min read)

Both are in the GitHub repo.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📅 NEXT STEPS:

I'd like to schedule a 30-minute meeting to:
1. Show you how to monitor the automation (5 min)
2. Show you how to manually trigger reports (5 min)
3. Walk through troubleshooting (10 min)
4. Answer any questions (10 min)

After that meeting, you'll be fully equipped to own this project.

When would be a good time for you this week or next?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 KEY POINTS:

• System is production-ready and reliable
• Requires minimal maintenance (5 min/week)
• Well documented with step-by-step guides
• Easy to manually trigger if needed
• No coding knowledge required to manage

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

Thanks,
Kunsang
