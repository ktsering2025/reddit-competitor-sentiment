            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> These are my recipes that got delivered this week let me know if any of you have made these/how they are! 

- spicy maple chicken
- cheesy smash burgers (ive gotten this one more than once because it‚Äôs easy and I love making the fries) 
- silky Sicilian chicken penne 
- steak au poivre with maple sage sweet potatoes and lemony asparagus 
- cheesy chicken enchiladas 


Pic is the maple chicken. I just want to say that I feel bad for people that blindly follow some of these recipes for the first time that contain pepper flakes and trust hello fresh enough to EVER put the entire pack of red peppe...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I see the official consensus on here is that BA service as a whole has completely tanked ever since the recent rebrand. I‚Äôve been a customer since 2020 and it used to be very unusual to have any problems other than an occasional ingredient substitution or more rarely something that came spoiled. Now, there is some kind of significant issue every single week‚Äî meals entirely missing or incorrect, spoiled food, important ingredients replaced with something completely different (pomegranate syrup replaced with VEGETABLE CONCENTRATE‚Ä¶..) without so much as an explanatory email, and once a box was ju...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> For anyone on the fence, do not waste your money.

This was hands down the worst meal service I have ever tried. I enjoy Blue Apron, HelloFresh, and Daily Harvest. They have their ups and downs but are overall good. 

Purple carrot was literally trash. Very old and rotten vegetables wrapped in way too much plastic. The meals were inedible. My husband actually took the pot (mushroom stroganoff) outside because the smell was rancid. 

I tried to cancel immediately the day after delivery but of course there was no human to talk to. Just a useless AI chatbot that kept me trapped in a fruitless loo...</p>
