            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I was doing HF for a while. Had a few issues that I made me an unhappy customer. I switched to Marley Spoon. What a disaster! My second box in and I've already cancelled. Chicken blood contaminated everything. It was a gross, sticky mess. They don't separate veggies or bag them so when I say everything was ruined- I mean everything. I submitted my issue and they offered me a $9 credit. That is laughable. When I called customer service, you can't even be placed on hold. It's high volume and the call just ends. I requested a call back online but they say someone will get back to me in 24hrs.

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Ordered this meal and did not upgrade the steak. The steak was of great quality, not stringy or fatty. I made ours open face because stacking it all up in one side of the bun would have been a mess. I like Hello Fresh meals, I rate this one as “well above average”. </p>

- spicy maple chicken
- cheesy smash burgers (ive gotten this one more than once because it’s easy and I love making the fries) 
- silky Sicilian chicken penne 
- steak au poivre with maple sage sweet potatoes and lemony asparagus 
- cheesy chicken enchiladas 


Pic is the maple chicken. I just want to say that I feel bad for people that blindly follow some of these recipes for the first time that contain pepper flakes and trust hello fresh enough to EVER put the entire pack of red peppe...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh with customer dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> In recent months, our meals have auto-filled with a majority of pork dishes.  Ever since this started, at least two dishes have been pork, but typically three or sometimes all four (we're on a four-meal plan).  When I go to change my meals, the list of pork dishes goes on and on, while the number of dishes based on other meats is very slim.  Has something happened in the meat industry lately?  Maybe Hello Fresh got a great deal from pork suppliers?  Maybe it's regional? (we're in southern Texas)  Here I thought the recent improvements were supposed to improve variety.  I'm not unhappy with the...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh highlighting operational or quality issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Let me start out by saying, I'm a big fan of falafel. We often have a box of the mix in the pantry for a night when we aren't sure what we want to cook-- that being said-- this does it all wrong. The biggest issue is the falafel burger ends up really soft which is not an issue that you'd have normally with falafel, but there are a few divergences from the typical preparation that I think cause this. Firstly, they have you use canned chickpeas which is working against you with the moisture content. Hellofresh should just send a falafel mix or at least dried ground chickpeas if they want you to ...</p>

What is the difference between a referral code and a free box code?

A referral code is a link that looks like this: \`[https://www.factor75.com/plans?c=\[REDACTED\]&discount\_comm\_id=\[REDACTED\]&plans\_ab=true&utm\_campaign=notification&utm\_medium=clipboard&utm\_source=freebies\`](https://www.factor75.com/plans?c=[REDACTED]&discount_comm_id=[REDACTED]&plans_ab=true&utm_campaign=notifi...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/ReadyMeals discusses Factor75 in the context of meal kit services.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I don't know where to ask this, but someone gave me a ton of Factor Meals and the best by date was 8/25. I said I'd try them instead of him throwing them out. 

My question is, are they still good? They were frozen apparently a little but after the date. </p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/ReadyMeals expresses concerns about Factor75 with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Do not sign up for Factor Meals unless you’re prepared to be locked in, or spend many excruciating hours trying to cancel.

Learn from my mistake and save yourself money, time, and frustration. 

Lured by a discount offer and intrigued by the possibility of portion controlled, healthy, pre-prepared meals, I made the mistake of visiting the Factor Meals website, only to get sucked in to what feels very much like a scam, with blatantly deceptive (and likely illegal) high-pressure marketing tactics. 

Selecting an initial delivery date and inputting a credit card is required just to view the meal...</p>
