            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I was doing HF for a while. Had a few issues that I made me an unhappy customer. I switched to Marley Spoon. What a disaster! My second box in and I've already cancelled. Chicken blood contaminated everything. It was a gross, sticky mess. They don't separate veggies or bag them so when I say everything was ruined- I mean everything. I submitted my issue and they offered me a $9 credit. That is laughable. When I called customer service, you can't even be placed on hold. It's high volume and the call just ends. I requested a call back online but they say someone will get back to me in 24hrs.

- spicy maple chicken
- cheesy smash burgers (ive gotten this one more than once because it‚Äôs easy and I love making the fries) 
- silky Sicilian chicken penne 
- steak au poivre with maple sage sweet potatoes and lemony asparagus 
- cheesy chicken enchiladas 


Pic is the maple chicken. I just want to say that I feel bad for people that blindly follow some of these recipes for the first time that contain pepper flakes and trust hello fresh enough to EVER put the entire pack of red peppe...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I've been subscribed to HelloFresh for over 2 years now, I originally subscribed when they offered the free add-on item for life with any active subscription. Loved all the fresh and delicious meals I've cooked over the years. 

Last Christmas, I was gifted a voucher for one free box from a family member (as an aside, it didn't even cover the full box price, only $80 but whatever). I finally redeemed it two weeks ago, and last week I received an email saying my subscription had been cancelled. I immediately logged in and re-activated the subscription, and confirmed there was an active card on ...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh highlighting operational or quality issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Let me start out by saying, I'm a big fan of falafel. We often have a box of the mix in the pantry for a night when we aren't sure what we want to cook-- that being said-- this does it all wrong. The biggest issue is the falafel burger ends up really soft which is not an issue that you'd have normally with falafel, but there are a few divergences from the typical preparation that I think cause this. Firstly, they have you use canned chickpeas which is working against you with the moisture content. Hellofresh should just send a falafel mix or at least dried ground chickpeas if they want you to ...</p>

Learn from my mistake and save¬†yourself money, time, and frustration. 

Lured by a discount offer and intrigued by the possibility of portion controlled, healthy, pre-prepared meals, I made the mistake of visiting the Factor Meals website, only to get sucked in to what feels very much like a scam, with blatantly deceptive (and likely illegal) high-pressure marketing tactics.¬†
