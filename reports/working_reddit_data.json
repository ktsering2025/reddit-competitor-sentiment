      "selftext": "I've been subscribed to HelloFresh for over 2 years now, I originally subscribed when they offered the free add-on item for life with any active subscription. Loved all the fresh and delicious meals I've cooked over the years. \n\nLast Christmas, I was gifted a voucher for one free box from a family member (as an aside, it didn't even cover the full box price, only $80 but whatever). I finally redeemed it two weeks ago, and last week I received an email saying my subscription had been cancelled. I immediately logged in and re-activated the subscription, and confirmed there was an active card on file still. My assumption is their system tried redeeming the gift card a second time, saw zero balance, and cancelled the account... But honestly I am unsure how this happened. Their support team offered no answers. I also noticed I no longer get the free add-on item with my weekly box and so I called customer service to report this issue.\n\nAfter multiple calls with their customer service, their best solution for me was offering me 40% off for one box, stating that they no longer offer the free item for life voucher and as such cannot re-activate it on my account. \n\nI am writing this post after a half hour long frustrating call with them where I cancelled my subscription and will be looking elsewhere since they refused to honor their own mistake. \n\nIf you plan on redeeming any sort of gift voucher code, please double check your account the following week or share the same situation I find myself in.",

I still want the meals to taste good, keep me full, and help me lose weight without feeling like I\u2019m eating bland diet food.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking into Factor, HelloFresh, and a few others, but I\u2019m not sure which one makes the most sense for my situation.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s tried different services like these, especially while focusing on weight loss and convenience, I\u2019d love to hear what worked best for you.\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\udcaa\n",

Just a useless AI chatbot that kept me trapped in a fruitless loop. A few days later a rep finally emailed me, not to fix anything, but to say they could not stop the next shipment and would refund me five dollars for the spoiled ingredients. \n\nI did not sign up for this service to argue over pocket change. I wanted healthy, easy plant-based meals. What I got was rotten trash in absurd amounts of plastic packaging.\n\nSave yourself the headache and avoid this service like the plague.\n\n",

      "title": "So what service is everybody switching to?",
      "selftext": "I see the official consensus on here is that BA service as a whole has completely tanked ever since the recent rebrand. I\u2019ve been a customer since 2020 and it used to be very unusual to have any problems other than an occasional ingredient substitution or more rarely something that came spoiled. Now, there is some kind of significant issue every single week\u2014 meals entirely missing or incorrect, spoiled food, important ingredients replaced with something completely different (pomegranate syrup replaced with VEGETABLE CONCENTRATE\u2026..) without so much as an explanatory email, and once a box was just skipped entirely without any notice for the first time in 5 years\u2026 of course I report these things every time, but in the past I\u2019d get a response right away, and now it takes several days before I get a partial refund! Like many (or all?) of you, I also got a physical letter in the mail with a coupon code for 50% off the next 2 boxes as a sort of apology for these repeated fuckups, which I guess was effective in terms of making me say \u201cokay I won\u2019t cancel for a couple of weeks,\u201d so I loaded up those boxes with extra stuff so I could get more bang for my buck, and then half of that stuff didn\u2019t even show up\u2026 so I get more credits on my account every week, and the cycle continues \ud83d\ude2d. (Plus, there seem to be more of the same meal options available every week\u2026) \n\nAll of this seems to point to a business that is dying anyway\u2026 I mean handing out 50% off coupons to make up for bad service and then doing nothing to change that service\u2026 it smacks of desperation. I feel like they\u2019ll shutter within a year at this rate. \n\nMeanwhile, I want to use a service like this to meal prep on weekends because I just started a 9-5 office job with a commute. So for me, quick, healthy and nutritious meals (or specifically things geared towards meal prep) would be a priority. (And of course, deliveries that are on time, fresh, and consist of the things that I actually ordered\u2026 but that *should* be a given.) I don\u2019t know much about any other meal kits so I\u2019m kind of lost when it comes to choice here. I tried Hello Fresh for a trial run back in 2020 and my perception was that the meals seemed a bit unhealthy (probably colored by the fact that they were sending random candy bars as freebies lol) but this could be inaccurate/ things could have changed since then.  \n\ntl;dr **If you\u2019re leaving Blue Apron for a different meal kit service, which one are you choosing and why?** Any prior experience you\u2019ve had with these services would be appreciated\u2014 although as we all know, it\u2019s not necessarily applicable to the present, as these things can easily go to shit.
