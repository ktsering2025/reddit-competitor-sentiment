I don't know if the recipes change from one country to another but as a vegetarian I've hat loads of delicious meals to cook and cooking/eating has been a pleasure since then ! \n\nPictures:\n\n1- Vegetarian Loc lac \n2- Mushroom linguine \n3- Thai style noodles with satay sauce\n4- Satay fried tofu with noodles \n5- portobello penne with hazelnut\n6- Cold thai salad with noodles\n7- veggie African style Maf\u00e9\n8- Aioli and portobello mushroom burger and potato wedges with herbs\n9- Chorba Aadess (Egyptian lentil soup) with toasts\n10- Filipino Monggo (mungo bean soup)\n11- Leek and mushrooms \"Galette\" (it's a veggie version of traditional dish from Brittany)\n12- Mushroom Conchiglie with parmesan \n13- Toasts from Normandy (with an onion and apple chutney and Camembert Cheese) with salad with apple, hazelnut and honey dressing.\n14- Cheesy enchiladas with black beans and salad and sweet potato fries (they're not on the picture but they were really \ud83d\udc4d)\n15- Rigatoni with portobello mushroom and  spinach sauce (+ I added sesame seed to top it all)\n16- beyond burger with Italian grated cheese and onion chutney, roquette salad and fries with spices\n17- grilled tofu with a satay sauce and its rice and veggies cooked in coconut milk.\n\nThere are lots of them that I love and I forgot to take pictures of but I gotta say the burgers and the Normandy's toasts are very popular here at home. The Filipino Monggo was an awesome discovery and is so delicious I made it twice despite being long to prepare for me (my hands are very weak and I am going to get surgery for it, I hope it will allow me to cut the veggies faster after this, bc I am so done with spending 1h cutting two carrots, one onion and a cucumber u____u )\n\nANYWAYS! What's YOUR favorite Hello fresh meal and have you ever had one of the meals on my pictures? If yes how did you like them? :)\n\nHave a nice day wherever you are in the world! \ud83d\udc95",

      "selftext": "Okay, I know this subject has been discussed over and over again...sorry...\n\n  \nI have been using Hello Fresh for about 4 years.  I really enjoy it, and I've had lots and lots of really good food.  I honestly have zero complaints other than....those damn potato wedges!\n\nMy boys (14 year old twins) and I love all the sandwiches- fish, mushroom, burger, etc.  And ALL of them come with potato wedges.  I didn't like the potatoes the first time I got them.  By the 10th time I was starting to loathe them, and by now- these dang potato wedges are the bane of my existence!  (Okay, that was totally dramatic...but really, I don't like them at all!)\n\nThis morning, I was hoping that with the expanded customization, I could replace the potatoes.  On the first couple of meals I looked at, there were no replacements- yes, I could choose pork for the burgers, but that was it.  \n\nOn another meal (cheesy smashed burgers) I saw that asparagus or green beans were an option.  I assume that is a replacement for the potatoes?  If so, I would take asparagus over potatoes every time.   Has anyone gotten this replacement?\n\nI had planned on starting to make mashed potatoes instead of wedges, but I am worried about the timing.  Can you make mashed potatoes in the same time that the wedges cook?  We really do rely on the timing on the menu cards, and I have no idea what the timing would be for mashed potatoes.  I know it is a simple question, but we are just 3 simple dudes trying to make burgers, and I have no clue.\n\nI don't really want to improve the wedges, because I have gotten them at least 200 times (really....4 years, average 1.5 times per week, that is a lot of potato wedges!) and I'm really done with them. Last night I had them with the schnitzel and once again I passed up the chance to make mashed potatoes because...well, because once we start rolling, I don't want to change things up and mess up the timing.  \n\nHelp a brother and his sons out.  What is the answer for anything BUT roasted potatoes?  Something that can be done in the same time as a cheesy smashed burger?\n\n",

      "selftext": "Or is it Tempo by Kroger from Home Chef?\n\nFirst meal prep delivery! I am attempting to eat more healthy as I have various issues that will supposedly be cured with \u201cdiet & exercise\u201d. Well suck it, chronic health issues make both of those things nearly impossible. I will be starting on tirzepatide soon and will slowly begin working in some strength training and toning. But the diet problem\u2026that\u2019s a conundrum. I can\u2019t cook, don\u2019t cook and absolutely will not ever have the energy that all entails. Thus, trying out meal prep delivery services. \n\nI\u2019m starting with Tempo (aka Kroger branded Home Chef meals) as they are one the cheapest right now with 60% off your first order (as low as *$4.99* a meal! Yeah, before shipping). Have I mentioned that I\u2019m cheap as fuck? That\u2019s important to remember here. My goal is to only order once or twice a month thus keeping the shipping costs to a minimum. Most of these meals can be frozen and the ones I received were good for at least 10 days to 2 weeks. So stock up and save (on shipping). I ordered on a Friday and they were delivered on Monday morning.  \n\nI am trying to justify (see above re: being cheap) the cost of doing this. And let\u2019s face it, food prices are ridiculous right now. By doing this I am saving money by not wasting food, and not buying with my stomach instead of my head. I am also saving *energy* and *time* both very valuable things, especially to someone with chronic illnesses. I am also appealing to the part of me that has started craving variety and fresher food - I am so sick of processed everything.\n\nI am however being very terrible to the environment. Yes, a lot of the packaging can be reused or recycled IF you live somewhere with a decent recycling system. Oregon has yoyo\u2019d back and forth forever over what can be recycled and it\u2019s difficult to keep track of. Currently some of this cannot be recycled. And I feel bad. But my body feels better?\n\n10 meals plus shipping ($10.99 for us) came to $60.91 so just over 6 bucks a meal. (Rakuten also has a $10 back on your first order deal, check that out if you use it!) \n\n(As an aside, I made the rookie mistake of forgetting when the next week charged vs when to have your menu selected - so got charged nearly full price for another 10 meals. However, their customer service chat on the website was fast, easy and efficient - credited the charge immediately and apologized for the confusion!)\n\nAll in all, I was really pleased with most of these meals. They had good variety, amazing serving sizes and just really easy & tasty food.\n\nWould anyone be interested in my individual meal reviews?\n\nAffiliate links in bio.  Disclaimer blah blah this is not a sponsored post, I paid for this service with my own money and these are my honest blatherings etc etc.",

Somehow, even though I'm following the recipes as written, I'm burning food to the point that it's inedible frustratingly often. That didn't happen once with BA.\n\nBaked brie pasta recipe said to put thinly sliced shallot and chopped garlic (and other things) in an oven-safe skillet and roast at 425 for 35-40 mins. At 35 mins, of course it was completely black, burnt, and bitter.\n\nAnother recipe had me broil carrots for something like 6-10 mins. Sure, it warned me that not all broilers are the same, but after less than 3 mins black smoke was coming out of the sides and the fire alarm went off.\n\nCaramelizing onions: the recipe casually said to use medium-high heat for something like 20-25 mins and scrape up any that get stuck to the bottom. I only learned later that other recipes say to be careful to keep the heat low.\n\nAnd another had me roast sliced red onion for way too long. Again, almost powdery black.\n\nWe use our oven often for baking with no issues; it's calibrated well enough. And we roasted things all the time for BA and nothing burned.\n\nI had heard Marley Spoon is for slightly more experienced cooks. That's fine. I suppose there's a lesson here in knowing my food and cooking techniques. I should probably know how to carmelize onions. But in all these cases, the only way to make the recipes work would have been to second guess basic, unambiguous, adversarial instructions.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

My husband and I have sent in multiple customer support issues during the transition and they have been responsive\u2026 BUT recently I have to say there have been a few meals where we have looked at each other and said, \u201cwow - this is good.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s my husband\u2019s cooking skills but\u2026 do we need to take a beat and let this happen? Give them some grace? I promise I have not been paid. Quick check into my profile I am all new mom and random stuff.\n",

However, when I go to support to declare that it wasn't delivered, my only option is to go to their FAQ. I tried to contact them through their page, but even that didn't work and led to a page that doesn't load. And now the Marley Spoon app won't open at all. On their FAQ page, it says they are having very high rates of people reaching out, so I'm just wondering if anyone else is having issues with this? ",
