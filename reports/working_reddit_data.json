I made the first one last night (mustard soy salmon) and it was shocking how quickly the salmon was devoured.\n\n\n\nI have one kid who really struggles with food (esp new foods) and they inhaled the salmon. I actually gave half their portion to my husband bc I figured kid wasn't going to be interested in something that different and new. Now I feel bad because they would have eaten the whole thing!\n\n\n\nWhile I agree that the protein portions were a little on the small side (though double would have been too much), I feel like the rice and carrots more than made up for it. The rice they send for 4 people is A LOT for us, which is fine bc my kids will eat plain rice as leftovers :D I didn't even cook all of the carrots because those suckers were HUGE, and we still had leftovers which I'll happily eat for lunch.\n\n\n\nI really appreciated the balance of ease in cooking on a weeknight with the flavors being interesting, like adding lime zest to the roasted carrots.\n\n\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't get a photo before everyone CHOWED DOWN. I promise this is not an ad, lol.",

Their meat was never terrible to me (it was fine). Not high quality, but still fine. However, since about a month ago, I have found their meat to be quite awful, particularly the ground meat (including sausage). It seems to be filled with a lot of filler or something because it reminds me almost of hot dogs if they were ripped into pieces, but ofc, the taste is not the same as hot dogs but it also doesn't taste like it should. I have never experienced this with ground meats that I purchased elsewhere... \n\nI am definitely going to cancel next month (my partner asked we do it for the next month as we are busy) and, in the meantime, avoid the ground meats but it is unfortunate because they are often in quicker meals. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this?

I may end up regretting that by the end of Sunday when I do the second one.\n\nI thought this was pretty good, especially the rice, probably in part because it contained the drippings from the chicken. The chicken itself was pretty good, with seasoning it at the beginning with a combo of garlic powder and salt and then towards the end, basting it with some sweet soy glaze.

In the past, I always knew about the different special collections- like the 'Fall Flavors' category, etc.  I remember when I would see snowmen made out of mashed potatoes, or when there was Hispanic Heritage month, with special meals with South American flavors, etc.  I always read about the collections, got excited about new meals, etc.\n\nToday I was choosing some meals, and I came across something from The Office.  And another one that was like 'Meals with a Purpose' or something like that.  And when they have these, I wonder what the theme is, etc.  Like I saw Kevin's Chili, I assume there are other, similar meals?\n\nWhen my kids were younger, there were a few collections that we really liked.  It was always fun to try the new items to change it up.  There was a Guardians of the Galaxy thing, and I believe we got every meal, because there was some sort of collectible in them.\n\nDoes anyone know where we can read about the new collections?  Like what are all of The Office meals?  ",

      "title": "Honest Hungryroot review",
      "selftext": "I've been trying Hungryroot for a few months now and here's my review. \n\n1. To start, I have a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions which had me extremely stressed when trying to look up recipes and make food. I was desperate to find something to make my life easier.  I did the quiz on their website and of course they wanted me to pay before seeing the food options. No thanks. I emailed customer service and they basically gave me \"we have a lot of options so give us a try\" answer. Um, no. Not if I don't know if I can eat the food! After some back and forth and a bad review for the rep I finally received the link for all of their food options. I found a few recipes I could eat so I decided to give it a try. Sifting through the food options does become a lot easier after you sign up because you can kind of create your profile and preferences. I do not like this, I wish they were transparent about everything from the beginning.\n2. I've gotten probably 8 boxes by now, 1 has been late and some of the food was bad. I've had a few bad items in multiple boxes. I've always gotten a quick refund with extra for the inconvenience and they say they talked to the packing team. My last box was perfect so hopefully things are improving? We shall see. (Of note: customer service starting after my first interaction has been very good)\n3. I pay about $105 each week for just me. This includes \"points\" for 3 lunches, 4 dinners, and 5-7 servings of sweets. Portion sizes are huge in my opinion. I started stretching this out for almost every meal for the week. I always end up eating somewhere else for 1-2 meals for the week but the food I get from hungryroot lasts me for the rest of the week. If something tells me I can get 2 servings out of it, I can typically make it into 4 meals. I always end up having enough food to feed my husband a few meals out of the week as well.\n4. The food is pretty fresh which is a huge plus for me because I can't eat a lot of preservatives without issues. The downside is it spoils pretty quickly. I had 2 bags of mozzarella cheese in the fridge, one from Hungryroot and one from Walmart. The one from hungryroot has spoiled already in less than 2 months. \n5. 99% of the meals I've gotten take less than 20 minutes to make and are very easy. This is perfect because I really hate cooking and don't have a lot of time anyway. I did get one meal that took forever to make and it was awful so I try to keep to the more simple options. \n6. Most of the food I get is really tasty! I am a very picky eater (on top of everything else lol) so a huge plus for me.\n\nI'm conclusion, I will be keeping my hungryroot subscription because it makes my life so much easier. If I didn't have so many restrictions I probably wouldn't use it because of cost. I did look at quite a lot of meal service options and none of the others are as good for my dietary restrictions. Hope this helps someone looking into it. \n\n",

People talk about what a great deal it is but it's only one meal a day usually and only for the days you pick. So you have to buy groceries for the rest of the days unless you plan on starving. For example let's say you do three meals a week. They're still four more days and breakfast and lunch on top of the days you're getting the boxes. Idk. It's confusing. It would be different if it was a great deal and covered 7 days a week breakfast lunch and dinner. Do people just not think this through?",
