I\u2019ve noticed that the calories are very high for a lot of the meals even the low-calorie meals are pretty high in calorie for what you get out of it. I am usually able to make pretty satiating meals for like 400 cal by just having good sources of protein, fat and carbs. In addition, I feel like after I eat HelloFresh meals I\u2019m still hungry most of the time and I\u2019ve had the serving size recommended. Anyone else experience this?\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that I have been portion controlling my food for a very long time. When I meal prep I weigh everything out so it is to serving size or maybe 1.5 servings to adequately support my workouts and active lifestyle.",

      "selftext": "Wow, I've been with Hello Fresh for 242 boxes, as they so happily told me in my call today.  My bread arrived flat as a pancake because it was packed on the bottom, underneath the ice packs and meat.  The website didn't auto-refund the problem report, and the agent chat stayed empty for over an hour last night and a half hour this morning before I called them.\n\nThey somehow knew I got the bread on sale, and only offered to refund the bread price.  I would have accepted this if it was automatic, but not after I wasted this much time, now I want replacement value at a minimum.  But how did they know I bought it on sale?  I didn't know.  I don't plan my meals, my partner does, and she chooses them weeks in advance (as far out as they allow).\n\nThere is \\*NO\\* itemized receipt on the web portal, or in my e-mail.  An invoice takes about an hour to send me in e-mail, and all it shows is the total that was charged, not what was charged and how much those items were.\n\nIn 2025, this is shocking.  I can't even see it for the current order which is somehow still pending, so I literally have no idea how much we were charged for that bread.\n\nI've been getting more disappointed with Hello Fresh.  This is a premium service, and I pay for it because it solves a lot of decision fatigue and portion control issues, but at this point it's starting to add more headache than it's worth.\n\nWho packs bread on the \\*BOTTOM\\* ?!?!?!",

      "title": "HelloFalseAdvertisement",
      "selftext": "I decided to give hellofresh a try after receiving a promo email for a free caraway pan plus a discount on the first few boxes. My subscription started at the beginning of September. After meeting the criteria of receiving my first 3 boxes I should have got my redemption code within 14 days but received nothing. I still had my subscription active and was receiving boxes weekly as normal. \n\nI reach out over email to support a couple times with no response so finally I call in, at this point I have received 6 boxes so double the qualifying amount for the promo. The lady in support tells me they don\u2019t have any more codes at the moment but to keep checking my email and I should have one within 5-10 days. I decided to go ahead and pause my service until we get this sorted out. Well that time passes and I call back again. Same conversation. Fast forward to today I call in and the rep informs me that the promo has ended so I won\u2019t be getting a code. He agrees that I had signed up and completed the criteria well before the promo ended but says \u201csorry there isn\u2019t any more codes\u201d \n\nObviously this is frustrating after all the waiting and emails and calls and me holding up my end of the deal but I told him hey that\u2019s fine just refund me the first 3 boxes then since that was what I had to purchase to qualify for it. He says \u201cunfortunately I\u2019m not able to do that\u201d so I ask him how we move forward and he says \u201cwell sir the promo has ended and as much as I would like to refund you i can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry about that\u201d \n\nUmmmmmm ok so you can\u2019t get me the pan, you can\u2019t refund the boxes, and you don\u2019t have any ideas on another resolution other than \u201csorry\u201d? So at this point I lost my temper a little and told him to get his boss on the phone to sort this out. He passes me off to his supervisor and the supervisor says pretty much all the same stuff but then say \u201cI\u2019m going to refund you $125 dollars for the value of the pan.\u201d While I appreciate that he offered some sort of resolution I expressed to him that I wanted to price of the first 3 boxes back which was about $220 bucks after the discounts. He told me that he couldn\u2019t do that because the value of the pan was $125 and I had still received the food. Now to be clear I\u2019m a rational person and can fully understand what he is saying, had this resolution came about right after my 3rd box or the first time I called asking about my pan I would have gladly accepted it. However the point is that I wouldn\u2019t have signed up at all and paid for not only 3 but 6 boxes total had I known I wouldn\u2019t get the promo they lured me in with. On top of that I\u2019ve wasted my time with multiple calls and emails and lies from their reps over the last month and half to get to this point so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unfair by asking to be refunded for the first 3 boxes I purchased to qualify for the promo. Hell I think some people would have asked for all 6 boxes to be refunded on the premise that they were enrolled under the guise of a lie regarding what they would receive but I\u2019m trying to be fair. After some back and forth he wouldn\u2019t budge so I told him not to issue anything right now because I\u2019m not accepting that as a resolution and I\u2019ll just dispute my first 3 charges from them with my credit card company and they can sort it out together. We will see what happens.\n\nAnyways I know you guys clicked in for \u201cTips and Tricks\u201d so here you go TIP: don\u2019t believe anything hellofresh or it\u2019s phone reps tell you! It might just be a TRICK!    F*ck you hellofresh. ",

This week they substituted chicken for shrimp in my shrimp penne recipe.\n\nA few of the meals have been really insanely unhealthy too. Cream cheese in half the recipes and overly salty.

      "selftext": "At first, factor has good savings. But as the weeks go on it becomes way too expensive to justify your return. I started with 6 meals a week and the daily greens supplement. Not too bad for the first free box, then discounts, then 1 freebie. You\u2019re like hell yeah. But as soon as the discounts disappear from your box deliveries it becomes hard to stomach the price $125-$150 for 6 meals and $86 for my supplements once a month. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my last order that I received 4 boxes for almost NINETY DOLLARS!! I mean it\u2019s bad. \n\nI cancelled both my subscriptions today. The food is hit or miss. It\u2019s pretty decent but it isn\u2019t great. Like others have stated the portions are really small. I realized I can eat just as healthy for 70% cheaper and have more filling meals at home. \n\nThe thing is, that with this meal service you first look at it because of the discounts and freebies and think it\u2019s awesome. But this isn\u2019t the case. This meal service takes advantage of people trying to lose weight or save time in the kitchen charging $10-$18 a meal. They massively overcharge you with small meals, not so great quality, and an untrusted delivery method that can arrive at 11pm with sour goods. You\u2019re promised before 8pm but the latest I\u2019ve got my orders were 12:30am. \n\nMy 3/10 reflects the ease of service and decent tasting food on a few meals I liked. I\u2019ve had over 45 meals from factor and have lost 2 pounds. The lack of portions resulted in bigger breakfast and lunches. So there\u2019s little upside. \n\nI hope this review helps you to not make a decision to invest in this meal service and to just take 2 hours on a weekend to cook and meal prep for yourself. You will save over $200 a month doing so depending on your plan. ",

Only paused for vacations, or a few times to take a break.  Never once had a delivery with warm food. Had late deliveries maybe ten times over the four years. Never once felt sick in any way from the food. Sometimes the quantity per serving was bordering on huge, other times just acceptable imo.\n\nLove the salmon and shrimp meals. Chicken is fine, just repetitive. The fact the offer cauliflower mashed is huge for low carb.\n\nDealing with customer service was a mixed bag, would probably rate as a C+\n\nMy biggest complaint looking back is all the packaging waste. For years the foil inner package insulation layer was not the most recycleable. They seem to have it dialed in now. Other than that I have nothing bad to say.
