I made the first one last night (mustard soy salmon) and it was shocking how quickly the salmon was devoured.\n\n\n\nI have one kid who really struggles with food (esp new foods) and they inhaled the salmon. I actually gave half their portion to my husband bc I figured kid wasn't going to be interested in something that different and new. Now I feel bad because they would have eaten the whole thing!\n\n\n\nWhile I agree that the protein portions were a little on the small side (though double would have been too much), I feel like the rice and carrots more than made up for it. The rice they send for 4 people is A LOT for us, which is fine bc my kids will eat plain rice as leftovers :D I didn't even cook all of the carrots because those suckers were HUGE, and we still had leftovers which I'll happily eat for lunch.\n\n\n\nI really appreciated the balance of ease in cooking on a weeknight with the flavors being interesting, like adding lime zest to the roasted carrots.\n\n\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't get a photo before everyone CHOWED DOWN. I promise this is not an ad, lol.",

Their meat was never terrible to me (it was fine). Not high quality, but still fine. However, since about a month ago, I have found their meat to be quite awful, particularly the ground meat (including sausage). It seems to be filled with a lot of filler or something because it reminds me almost of hot dogs if they were ripped into pieces, but ofc, the taste is not the same as hot dogs but it also doesn't taste like it should. I have never experienced this with ground meats that I purchased elsewhere... \n\nI am definitely going to cancel next month (my partner asked we do it for the next month as we are busy) and, in the meantime, avoid the ground meats but it is unfortunate because they are often in quicker meals. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this?

I couldn\u2019t decide between them so because they were not premium and they both had the same time it would take and the same difficulty level, I got both. I may end up regretting that by the end of Sunday when I do the second one.\n\nI thought this was pretty good, especially the rice, probably in part because it contained the drippings from the chicken. The chicken itself was pretty good, with seasoning it at the beginning with a combo of garlic powder and salt and then towards the end, basting it with some sweet soy glaze. I think it took me about an hour and 45 minutes total, but a lot of that was waiting for things to cook, especially the chicken. I\u2019m not sure it needed 3 sauces but fortunately, there was only one that was cooked, ginger scallion sauce, though I didn\u2019t particularly like it. I didn\u2019t think this recipe was particularly hard, though it\u2019s labeled as such, just involved and it took awhile to cook as half chickens typically do\n\nI really recommend this recipe\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of the first serving, with the leg part\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhsvxj4tonvf1.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfd8eb6dbe55532e9d7ff354855a721ceb619f86",

I thought I had grabbed the wrong bag when I first opened it but checked and it was definitely the right bag. Just wrong sauce. Contacted customer service to let them know and they kept saying I wasn\u2019t going to get anymore compensation (totally fine with that, I was just letting them know that I had an issue). Anyone else have an issue with the tamarind meatballs this week? ",

After I groused and yelled and got a supervisor, the company said they'd put the amount of the missing meal back on my gift card, refunded the double billing to my debit card, and that I could resume my experience.\n\nThen the third week happened.\n\nI don't even have resolution yet.  I got an email stating they've cancelled my account and cancelled my delivery for this week.  I haven't talked to customer service yet, but you can believe they're about to get an earful.

      "title": "Honest Hungryroot review",
      "selftext": "I've been trying Hungryroot for a few months now and here's my review. \n\n1. To start, I have a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions which had me extremely stressed when trying to look up recipes and make food. I was desperate to find something to make my life easier.  I did the quiz on their website and of course they wanted me to pay before seeing the food options. No thanks. I emailed customer service and they basically gave me \"we have a lot of options so give us a try\" answer. Um, no. Not if I don't know if I can eat the food! After some back and forth and a bad review for the rep I finally received the link for all of their food options. I found a few recipes I could eat so I decided to give it a try. Sifting through the food options does become a lot easier after you sign up because you can kind of create your profile and preferences. I do not like this, I wish they were transparent about everything from the beginning.\n2. I've gotten probably 8 boxes by now, 1 has been late and some of the food was bad. I've had a few bad items in multiple boxes. I've always gotten a quick refund with extra for the inconvenience and they say they talked to the packing team. My last box was perfect so hopefully things are improving? We shall see. (Of note: customer service starting after my first interaction has been very good)\n3. I pay about $105 each week for just me. This includes \"points\" for 3 lunches, 4 dinners, and 5-7 servings of sweets. Portion sizes are huge in my opinion. I started stretching this out for almost every meal for the week. I always end up eating somewhere else for 1-2 meals for the week but the food I get from hungryroot lasts me for the rest of the week. If something tells me I can get 2 servings out of it, I can typically make it into 4 meals. I always end up having enough food to feed my husband a few meals out of the week as well.\n4. The food is pretty fresh which is a huge plus for me because I can't eat a lot of preservatives without issues. The downside is it spoils pretty quickly. I had 2 bags of mozzarella cheese in the fridge, one from Hungryroot and one from Walmart. The one from hungryroot has spoiled already in less than 2 months. \n5. 99% of the meals I've gotten take less than 20 minutes to make and are very easy. This is perfect because I really hate cooking and don't have a lot of time anyway. I did get one meal that took forever to make and it was awful so I try to keep to the more simple options. \n6. Most of the food I get is really tasty! I am a very picky eater (on top of everything else lol) so a huge plus for me.\n\nI'm conclusion, I will be keeping my hungryroot subscription because it makes my life so much easier. If I didn't have so many restrictions I probably wouldn't use it because of cost. I did look at quite a lot of meal service options and none of the others are as good for my dietary restrictions. Hope this helps someone looking into it. \n\n",

Do they really are that convinced that we are that dumb? \ud83d\ude02 \n",

      "selftext": "Most people think weight loss is all about calories and exercise, but your sleep patterns dictate more than you realize. If you don't sleep well, your body is constantly operating in a state of stress, and no diet can change that.\n\n\n\nWhen you don't get enough sleep, your hunger hormones change. You feel hungrier, your cravings increase, and your ability to regulate your appetite is impaired. Your body increases cortisol, a hormone that signals fat storage, especially around your belly. This decreased energy and motivation makes it harder to exercise or even prepare healthy meals.\n\n\n\nI've seen clients lose weight faster by improving their sleep before returning to their diet. Once you get regular sleep, everything else becomes easier. Cravings naturally decrease, exercise improves recovery, and overall discipline speeds up without additional effort.\n\n\n\nIf you're struggling to lose weight, stop cutting calories so deeply and stop adding more cardio. Go to bed earlier, keep your room dark and cool, and aim for seven to eight hours of uninterrupted rest each night. Track your sleep for a week and see how your hunger pangs and progress change.\n\n\n\nWeight loss isn't just an effort; it's a physiological process, and that process depends on rest.\n\n\n\nYou can't recover from a constantly exhausted body.\n\n\n\nGet enough sleep, and your body will eventually start working with you instead of against you.",

People talk about what a great deal it is but it's only one meal a day usually and only for the days you pick. So you have to buy groceries for the rest of the days unless you plan on starving. For example let's say you do three meals a week. They're still four more days and breakfast and lunch on top of the days you're getting the boxes. Idk. It's confusing. It would be different if it was a great deal and covered 7 days a week breakfast lunch and dinner. Do people just not think this through?",

      "selftext": "Hi All!\n\nCooking (like many of us) is a huge love language of mine. My birthday is coming up and I said what I truly wanted was to make her an incredible lasagna since she's been asking for one and hers growing up was of the cottage cheese/jarred sauce variety. I asked her if she wanted a Lasagna Bolognese with the b\u00e9chamel but she said she'd rather have the ricotta version which is fine! She is also footing the bill for any of the ingredients and told me to go to the fancy Italian market nearby *swoon*\n\nI realize this sounds like a gift for her but it truly brings me joy to cook for my loved ones and I don't get to make her labor intensive stuff often due to us living a few hours apart from each other.\n\nI was originally going to take my birthday off of work but unfortunately I had a death in my family of someone close to me where we were told he had 12-18 months but it wound up being about 4... that heartbreak coupled with my being down for the count with bronchitis made me miss some work so I'm not willing to take the whole day off for my birthday anymore.\n\nI know I can (and should) prepare any sauce well before hand and I plan to do homemade ricotta and whatnot... so my questions is do you think it would be better to assemble everything the night before and leave it covered and unbaked in the fridge and bake the day of? My roommate can take it out of the fridge a bit before I get home from work so it won't be straight from the fridge cold OR should I bake and cool the night before and reheat to serve? I've always assembled/baked/served the same day so unsure which option would be the best in this case. Obviously leftover lasagna is incredible haha but I want the wow factor!",
