I have called the customer service line multiple times to tell them of this mistake, they have said to hold on to the box and if someone doesn't come by a certain time, to utilize the items myself... I have told them I very much don't want someone to be missing their meals and I worry whoever this actually belongs to, is dealing with chaos from the company or is out food they needed for the week... it has now been weeks of this, I just have a hard time believing there isn't a problem somewhere...it almost seems too good to be true if I am honest. I am low income and disabled so I am VERY thankful for the extra help, and it's been a blessing to receive this \"free\" box each week. But, i can't help but fear there's a catch.... I don't really have people in my life, I know my mom isn't secretly ordering this for me, she couldn't afford to.... and she is the only one who \"would\" do such for me anyways... \n\nso, assuming this is not a random act of kindness.... how would you approach this situation to make sure all is handled correctly? I have called multiple times and it still comes each week... I don't want it to stop, but, I am not paying for the service and i'm sure someone is... I am feeling guilty even though I have tried to resolve this.  \nMy main fear involves getting a bill eventually and that me getting the box means someone is missing out each week on something they are paying for... \n\n  \nAny advice on how to handle this would be great, thank you ",

Ever since this started, at least two dishes have been pork, but typically three or sometimes all four (we're on a four-meal plan).  When I go to change my meals, the list of pork dishes goes on and on, while the number of dishes based on other meats is very slim.  Has something happened in the meat industry lately?  Maybe Hello Fresh got a great deal from pork suppliers?  Maybe it's regional? (we're in southern Texas)  Here I thought the recent improvements were supposed to improve variety.  I'm not unhappy with the dishes I ultimately pick, but this has added a lot of time to have to manage.",

      "selftext": "Let me start out by saying, I'm a big fan of falafel. We often have a box of the mix in the pantry for a night when we aren't sure what we want to cook-- that being said-- this does it all wrong. The biggest issue is the falafel burger ends up really soft which is not an issue that you'd have normally with falafel, but there are a few divergences from the typical preparation that I think cause this. Firstly, they have you use canned chickpeas which is working against you with the moisture content. Hellofresh should just send a falafel mix or at least dried ground chickpeas if they want you to add the spices to it. Secondly, you bake these chickpea burgers, and that might be because the mixture is wetter than it should be, but it has an end product that lacks that crust to hold it together. Thirdly, the toasted buns are much firmer than the patties so everything just kind of smushes together; I abandoned one of the buns after two bites. The spices weren't really enough for either the falafel mix or the \"Sesame Symphony\" (sub-text za'atar -- c'mon Hellofresh). Also, I think regular potatoes would have worked better with za'atar on them or another vegetable. Lastly, I am a little surprised they went with a vegan tzatziki sauce over an already vegan more typical tahini sauce. Don't get me wrong, I love tzatziki, but this was all a miss. ",

Loved all the fresh and delicious meals I've cooked over the years. \n\nLast Christmas, I was gifted a voucher for one free box from a family member (as an aside, it didn't even cover the full box price, only $80 but whatever). I finally redeemed it two weeks ago, and last week I received an email saying my subscription had been cancelled. I immediately logged in and re-activated the subscription, and confirmed there was an active card on file still. My assumption is their system tried redeeming the gift card a second time, saw zero balance, and cancelled the account... But honestly I am unsure how this happened. Their support team offered no answers. I also noticed I no longer get the free add-on item with my weekly box and so I called customer service to report this issue.\n\nAfter multiple calls with their customer service, their best solution for me was offering me 40% off for one box, stating that they no longer offer the free item for life voucher and as such cannot re-activate it on my account. \n\nI am writing this post after a half hour long frustrating call with them where I cancelled my subscription and will be looking elsewhere since they refused to honor their own mistake. \n\nIf you plan on redeeming any sort of gift voucher code, please double check your account the following week or share the same situation I find myself in.",

I then immediately cancelled my entire account, only to find that Factor still planned to charge me for the first order.\n\nIt took several hours and multiple frustrating attempts to contact customer support, by both phone and in-app chat, to finally get that first delivery canceled.\u00a0\n\nBoth the in-app chat and phone line had extreme wait times and would randomly (or deliberately?) disconnect.\u00a0\n\nWhen I finally got through, the customer service team was clearly following a system that makes it as hard as possible for customers to resolve issues, including he agent asking multiple times to verify information that I had already provided (such as my phone number and account name), and waiting 5+ minutes to reply between each response.\u00a0\n\nThe process was stressful, confusing, and felt intentionally designed to make it extremely difficult to opt out.\u00a0\n\nIf Factor\u2019s food is as good as they claim, they shouldn\u2019t need to trap new customers through not just misleading, but blatantly inaccurate \u201ccancel anytime\u201d promises and huge barriers to cancellation.\n\nThis experience completely ruined my trust in the company.\u00a0\n\nGiven the many negative reviews about the weird taste and texture of their food, and the misleadingly high fat and sodium content of their sauces, it seems like I dodged a bullet, but I wanted to warn anyone else thinking about inputting their information just to view the meals.\n\nTransparency and honesty go a long way. I hope Factor rethinks their misleading and shady practices, and hope everyone else thinks twice before signing up and getting locked in.\n\n_____\n\nTLDR: be warned that Factor Meals\nhas deliberately misleading marketing practices, blatant misstatements, and an extremely frustrating (and near impossible) cancellation experience.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I signed up HomeChef over the 2025 summer with a gift card from one of our friends, and from the start, the package got delivered too warm due to just one pack of ice with just one layer of insulation and high tempurature outside. So we took pictures of contents with our themometer, and the customer service credited back to our account. The following week was fine, then third week, it happened again and complaining about the lack of insulation and not many icepacks considering the high temperature outside. So customer service credited it back to our account again. Fourth and fifth week, we skipped the meal due to vacation, and 6th week, we resumed the delivery, and again they did not listen our recommendation of adding one more layer of insulation and/or adding more icepacks so foods got delivered too warm. They credit it back again, and by that time our account balance returned back to our original gift card redemption balance. Then seventh week, we receiving the package warm again and we tried to log onto our account to chat with customer service, but could not log in. So we chat with customer service agent without being logged in, and asked what happened to our account, and they said one of their supervisor closed the account, and they would contact us within 2 or 3 business days. So we waited, and noticed that we received an automated email on Monday already indicating that they were sorry that we had to leave with re-activate link. So we immediately respond to that email saying that we did not paused the account while we were waiting for their supervisor's explaination. By Wednesay, we did not receive any email, so we called the number, and customer service said that all supervisors were in training, so not available to speak with us, but they would contact us shortly. So Thursday, still no response. So we sent a complaint email to all email address available like support@homechef dot com, vendor@homechef dot com legal@homechef dot com etc. Finally we received an email from customer service with a refund terms and condition saying that they had right not to issue refund and could close account for any reason without revealing the reason. So we immediately responded back with what's happening with all the deliveries, but no response at all. We continued sent emails, but their silence really frustrated us. So we sent an official complaint to Better Business Bureau and our West Viriginia State Attorney's office indicating that it's so unfair for a business steal customer's money with this kind of business practice. We are still waiting for the resolution.   Has anyone had this similar or other bad experience with HomeChef or other meal plan service?",

      "selftext": "I see the official consensus on here is that BA service as a whole has completely tanked ever since the recent rebrand. I\u2019ve been a customer since 2020 and it used to be very unusual to have any problems other than an occasional ingredient substitution or more rarely something that came spoiled. Now, there is some kind of significant issue every single week\u2014 meals entirely missing or incorrect, spoiled food, important ingredients replaced with something completely different (pomegranate syrup replaced with VEGETABLE CONCENTRATE\u2026..) without so much as an explanatory email, and once a box was just skipped entirely without any notice for the first time in 5 years\u2026 of course I report these things every time, but in the past I\u2019d get a response right away, and now it takes several days before I get a partial refund! Like many (or all?) of you, I also got a physical letter in the mail with a coupon code for 50% off the next 2 boxes as a sort of apology for these repeated fuckups, which I guess was effective in terms of making me say \u201cokay I won\u2019t cancel for a couple of weeks,\u201d so I loaded up those boxes with extra stuff so I could get more bang for my buck, and then half of that stuff didn\u2019t even show up\u2026 so I get more credits on my account every week, and the cycle continues \ud83d\ude2d. (Plus, there seem to be more of the same meal options available every week\u2026) \n\nAll of this seems to point to a business that is dying anyway\u2026 I mean handing out 50% off coupons to make up for bad service and then doing nothing to change that service\u2026 it smacks of desperation. I feel like they\u2019ll shutter within a year at this rate. \n\nMeanwhile, I want to use a service like this to meal prep on weekends because I just started a 9-5 office job with a commute. So for me, quick, healthy and nutritious meals (or specifically things geared towards meal prep) would be a priority. (And of course, deliveries that are on time, fresh, and consist of the things that I actually ordered\u2026 but that *should* be a given.) I don\u2019t know much about any other meal kits so I\u2019m kind of lost when it comes to choice here. I tried Hello Fresh for a trial run back in 2020 and my perception was that the meals seemed a bit unhealthy (probably colored by the fact that they were sending random candy bars as freebies lol) but this could be inaccurate/ things could have changed since then.  \n\ntl;dr **If you\u2019re leaving Blue Apron for a different meal kit service, which one are you choosing and why?** Any prior experience you\u2019ve had with these services would be appreciated\u2014 although as we all know, it\u2019s not necessarily applicable to the present, as these things can easily go to shit.

Once in, I go to skip more weeks in advance and there\u2019s only one week showing now.\n\nSo now I skipped next week, which is the only week showing, and called to ask about recent unauthorized up charges in auto shipments, and also to ask about the app not showing any weeks in advance.

Looks like the only option is customer service, which is fine, just thought I remembered EP having one, though haven't used EP in awhile. ",
