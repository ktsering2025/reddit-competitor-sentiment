I'm trying to learn how to cook some new dishes so I don't keep eating the same thing every night. Changing the ingredients on me messed me up because I don't know if I'm supposed to cook it the same way or switch. Plus, frankly, I ordered three other meals with green beans I didn't want green beans with this one.\n\nMy question to you guys is this a regular occurrence? Do they like to substitute things? Are your boxes off and late should I change the delivery day back a day? I know what customer service says that it was an accident but if this is common I think I'll just cancel.\n\nEdit:\n well as a new member it turns out I just never got the alert about the broccoli stuff. It would have been nice of them to put a note on the website maybe an asterisk with the menus that are affected. It would have made a difference since I've had green beans with four of my meals this week lol. Still rather have green beans and carrots though so yaha",

I\u2019m a construction worker, so I try to hit some basic targets with my meals:\n\n* Around **30g+ protein** per serving\n* Around **10g fiber** per serving (8\u201312g is fine)\n\nWith HelloFresh, there are usually a couple meals each week that hit those numbers, or I can get there by adding extra greens, chia/flax seeds, etc. That works, but I\u2019m getting tired of their very simple recipes and the big markups on anything outside their standard pantry items. I don\u2019t mind paying a bit extra for special ingredients, but with HelloFresh it feels excessive.\n\nFor those of you who use Blue Apron:\n\n* How often do their meals naturally hit \\~30g protein and decent fiber?\n* Is it easy to tweak their recipes (add beans, greens, etc.) without breaking the meal?\n* Do you feel the ingredients/\u201cpremium\u201d items are priced more reasonably than HelloFresh?\n\nGiven my goals and work schedule, does Blue Apron sound like a better fit, or should I be looking more at Sunbasket instead?",

How does the recipe for Sweet Chili Beef Bowls forget about the Sweet chili sauces! Then I realized they had me cook the pepper and onions and transfer it to a plate but then never mentioned them again in the final steps.\n\n  \nLuckily once I realized that the steps were crap I was still able to add the sauces and veggies in with no problems but how did this get through any sort of quality control!? I thought maybe something was up with the cards they sent out but the same mistakes are on the recipe on the website as well.

      "selftext": "If you\u2019ve ever stared into a sad fridge (limp cilantro, lone zucchini) and nearly rage-ordered sushi, you already know the exact problem HelloFresh is trying to solve. The real question is less \u201cis it tasty?\u201d and more \u201cis this actually worth it in Canada once the promo dust settles?\u201d\n\nFor most Canadian households cooking 2\u20134 weeknights, HelloFresh can pull its weight *if* you treat it like a planning tool, not a forever splurge. You\u2019re paying to outsource the \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d decision, the grocery run, and the mid-aisle mental math, in exchange for 30\u201340 minute recipes, pre-portioned ingredients, and a rotating menu (about 40+ core meals, 100+ total items including add-ons). Realistically, ongoing pricing usually lands around \\~$10\u2013$14 per serving before promos, with shipping and fees shifting by region and week\u2014promo weeks are basically onboarding, not the baseline. The sweet spot is busy couples, parents, or newer cooks who\u2019d rather tap a few \u201cQuick & Easy\u201d or \u201cFamily Friendly\u201d tiles than doom-scroll recipes and hunt for cumin.\n\nOn the upside, there\u2019s solid variety (Italian, Middle Eastern, Indian, etc.), generally good portion sizes (no sad tiny mains bulked up with a random side salad), and reliable delivery with cold-chain packaging. The service shines if you care about less food waste, fewer midweek \u201cemergency\u201d $20 takeouts, and the mental relief of not planning everything from scratch. On the downside, it *will* cost more than ultra-frugal grocery cooking, there\u2019s packaging waste, you still need basic kitchen skills, and strict allergies or highly specific diets won\u2019t be fully flexible. The biggest hidden risk is behavioural, not culinary: forgetting to pause or cancel weeks you won\u2019t actually cook, or picking recipes that are too ambitious for a chaotic Tuesday.\n\nWhat do you value more right now: rock-bottom grocery costs and full control, or paying a premium to offload planning and guarantee that decent, varied dinners actually show up in your week without much thought?\ud83e\uddd0\n\n*Want the full breakdown?

Usually the meat is under 40 degrees as long as it stays between the ice gel packs (when they only use one pack it\u2019s hit or miss),  but the rest of the stuff in the box is usually between 40 and 55 degrees.  Some things don\u2019t matter, but this includes things like cream packets, mayonnaise, spinach (had one bag contain slime once) and every thing else.\n\nHas anyone actually had their box arrive under 40 degrees F?",

During times that I haven\u2019t subscribed to meal deliveries I\u2019ve always just browsed their website for recipes and grocery shopped the old fashioned way (Walmart grocery delivery these days). But Blue Apron doesn\u2019t provide a good interface for this so I figured I\u2019d make my own.\n\nIt\u2019s completely free, and hopefully others find it useful as well. Just like how Blue Apron does, the recipes are displayed in order of seasonality so that the first results you see will have ingredients that are easily sourceable at that time of year. Say, corn on the cobb and grilling recipes in the summer and winter squashes and soups in the winter.\n\n  \nIf you\u2019re looking to use up a specific ingredient from your kitchen you can search for recipes by ingredient (or multiple) or get AI-generated recommendations if you\u2019d rather describe something to make. The results are all just Blue Apron recipes.\n\n  \nYou can also rate recipes, create shopping lists, and easily get ingredient substitutes for the harder to come by ingredients that BA recipes sometimes have.\n\n  \nYou can sign up for free (will always be free) at [cooksmart.ai/signup/reddit](http://cooksmart.ai/signup/reddit)",
