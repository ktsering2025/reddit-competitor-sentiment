      "title": "Anyone else doing a realistic Christmas this year?",
      "selftext": "To preface this, this is not a judgement post. I'm not judging people and Im not shaming anyone at all. I grew up with really big Christmases. My parents kind of went over board. I of course appreciated it all. I did the same for my kids. They are now 7 and 2. I didn't post a photo online of my tree christmas morning last year because I thought it may have been too much and didn't want anyone to feel bad if they couldn't donthe same for their kids. But noticed how much people actually get is insane. \n\nThis year I went with everything I knew my kids would absolutely use. My daughter would tell me she wanted this one toy. I know her better than she does and I know she will play with a toy for 20 minutes then sit in her playroom forever, untouched. We decided to be more practical this year. Some things they needed. I wanted their Christmas to have more heart felt behind it. More thought. Our family does know the true meaning of Christmas. I thought what I got the kids this year was plenty. But now seeing videos of everyone else, I thought well maybe my kids christmas isn't all that exciting? \n\nOur daughters birthday is a week before christmas. Shes getting catchings gear and batting gloves. Our garage is long (so we have room to make it more of a sports area), so I was going to set up our foam squares so when we go out and practice throughout the year she can practice catching without scuffing up her gear and so she can practice diving for a ball without hurting herself. \n\nFor Christmas her big present is a hurricane category 4 Batting trainer. So I was going to have that set up for her in the garage. \nShe also loves flowers, every color, and she's my lady bug so I made her a quilt. It was my 2nd quilt ever. I put around 70 hours into it. It's a hexagon quilt so I made them into flowers and I sewed lady bugs onto them by hand. \nFor crafts she's been asking and I've been forgetting about this Stepping stone molding kit she's been asking for, it makes 4 and it looks fun and cute. It'll make her really happy. \nShe loves making jewelry and she has those flat clay disc beads so I got her a little kit with multiple colors instead of just the 3 she has. She will definitely use it. \nOther crafts include this paint by sticker book. She loves butterflies and animals so I got her one. With that she's really good at geography. She's in 2nd grade and so I got her this magnetic USA puzzle. \nHer 2 year old brother and her exchange a gift so I picked out this cat bath robe and got one of those big squishy hot pink duck. \nClothes. She wrestles too so I got her a new pair of shorts because she's getting taller. To go with it I got her an AC/DC shirt which is her favorite band. New \"bras\" for under her singlet, a 5 pack of tank tops because she doesn't have any. She's obsessed with kpop so I got her a kpop shirt. I think I may get her a zip up jacket for wrestling that's red and black (her team colors) that has \"wrestling\" x4 on the back with a black printed bow in the middle. It's cute. But for wrestling. A Softball poster. \n\nBooks she's been asking for Goosebumps so we got her a 10 pack (awesome deal got it for $20 when it was $60 presale). \n\nShe loves Harry potter so she got a hot cocoa set with color changing hot cocoa and mug and then the tree marshmallows when they come out (she asked for her same flower socks and mini marshmallows for Christmas lol). \nThe HP car lego and this cat camper lego kit \nI felt bad because her brother has all these toys hes getting. So she likes to watch hotel transylvania with her brother. We got those magnetic blocks hotel transylvania and a character kit of monsters to add to it.\nBeen asking for furblets we got her 2 so they interact. \nLastly, she's been asking for nail polish. And she uses lotion and perfume (the number of people who went onto my post freaking out because she likes wearing perfume. Kid scented appropriate. The one is literally called I scream float and is definitely for a little girl from bath and body works and the other one is strawberry pound cake that shimmers.people went crazy. Made me feel better when I saw people buy their little girls Perfume for Christmas). She also uses hand lotion and so from five below we got her nail polish, this nail polish kit, a 7 pack of different girly lotion.. I also picked her up kids fake nails with sticky tabs not nail glue. And the cute hand sanitizer spray with the case for her backpack. \nI still need to make her, her harry potter rice bag.\nThis all sounds like a lot but it doesn't look it at all when you look at it. She got all small things.\n\nMy son is 2. I'll try to make this brief. I also made him a quilt. I love it just as much. He loves dinosaurs, cars,  monster trucks etc. Picked him up a dinosaur, dinosaur transportation truck for his cars, Blu track you suction anywhere. It's the bendy race track, 2 sets of 5 pack cars, a steering wheel toy by vtec he's been wanting, his sister got him a monster truck bath robe with the same duck but yellow, potty training book, 2 of the small monster trucks, this grill is his big gift it changes the food color with steam. He's been wanting to grill, Robolive king python snake that slithers like a real one, dinosaur finger puppets, this pokemon squishmallow he runs to and hugs hard when he sees it at the store, an outfit. I plan on getting him more sweats because he's growing fast. His shirts are getting small. He just turned 2 but due to his height he fits it 3T and 4T shirts now. He loves wearing his sister's Apron with their kitchen. It's pink, too long, and I'm afraid he will get caught because the dtrap doesn't detach. So I'm making him a dark blue Apron with colorful dinosaur pockets and sewing on a premade dinosaur patch and the top will velcro so if it gets caught it won't choke him. May make him a matching chef hat. I also plan on getting him another 2 pack of monster trucks. Oh and for a really good deal I got him a big metal construction truck for half off.\nTogether they got Whoopee cushions because my son is obsessed with farting and forts always fall apart so she's been asking for a tent. So I got them one that you can store away. \n\nI know it sounds like a lot but it doesn't look like what it sounds. I just don't want their Christmas to be blah. My husband told me to pick out 1 or 2 more toys for our daughter too because she doesn't have too many age appropriate toys anymore. She's turning 8 but I don't want to stop getting her toys. Any ideas what to get her? I thought about an rc car? \n\nAnyways, I've been seeing people buy thousands worth (to me that's too much, but no judgement). I asked my friend if he and his wife started christmas shopping yet. He Said I just handed her $2500 for her to go shopping for the boys. They have 2 boys a year apart. I tried for everything to have a lot of meaning. Did I just not get enough? Or am I just over thinking? Honestly,is this a good christmas?",

      "title": "Future of $BYND",
      "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI just want to put my thoughts on this forum and I did sell my shares earlier and do have about 14000 shares to be transparent.\n\nThere are a lot of bad news and false information about $BYND.\n\nThere is barely any shorts to shorts today and I tried using Fidelity.\n\nThe stockprice had really rallied on 10/22 . Although, I don't think there was a squeeze to begin with. My thoughts is people were fomoing to jump on this because of FOMO. Short interest isn't an information you can get in real-time. There is a 2 weeks -4 weeks delay depending on the broker and when they report.\n\nAll things aside, $BYND is still a public company with many food products. Every quarter, they have been negative in net income similar to many food companies, Hostess, J.M Smuckers, etc. One interesting note is that they basically clear their debt with the recent convertible notes for 316 million shares and AVOIDED Bankruptcy. Notes lock up expiration was October 16. These would've been sold when we all pumped it to $7-$8 on October 22 by the funds who owned the notes.\n\nBeing in the Merger and Acquisition business, $BYND need to increase distribution channels, increase their profit margins, or get acquired by private equity. My thinking is they will be acquired, now that they have almost no debt and only assets.\n\nThere are many companies that got acquired with negative net income: BlueApron, Grubhub by Wondergroup. Sovos brand, by Campbell Soup (this one they turned around their net income at the last year, but generally operated at net loss of $50million +)\n\nThis company has potential to turn around given that it has essentially no major debt (less equity control). For people who been saying $BYND is a sh\\*t company. Think again about the food and beverage industry.\n\nKnowing in my field, this company will most likely be acquired if given the opportunity. We will see what Ethan and the board will do next.",

      "title": "Top New Releases for October 24",
      "selftext": "I know there\u2019s already a post about this, but let\u2019s answer all the relevant questions in one spot. First question, do you live in Portland, Oregon, or will you be in Portland on November 6? If so, get yourself an appointment and head over to 1040 NE 44th Ave to buy some very nice (primarily) wool garments from the Dehen folks at a significant discount! Yes, you actually need to book a 30min appointment to shop the sale in person. And yes, time slots are almost gone (as I\u2019m writing this I checked, and both Saturday and Sunday are completely booked up). If any slots are still available, you can book one here:\n\nhttps://dehen1920wffs25.as.me/schedule/2ddd28e5/appointment/70069424/calendar/4597971?appointmentTypeIds[]=70069424\n\nAnd for those of us not in the Rose City, we can still take advantage of the sale online starting the following week on November 13. If you\u2019re signed up for Dehen\u2019s e-mails, you\u2019ll get sent a link to start shopping the sale at 7AM PST on the 13th, and then the Dehen folks will drop that same link on Instagram for the general public at 9AM PST. In the past, this sale has been up and down. Last year there was a ton of amazing stuff available when the sale went live online: N1 Deck Jackets, Shawl Sweater Coats, Varsity Jackets, etc. And most pieces were available in the more popular sizes (not just XXL). Discounts ranged from over 50% off to a more typical 30% off depending on the garment. Just be aware, popular garments in popular sizes do sell quite fast. So my recommendation is to get on the sale as early as you can. For most of us, that probably means setting an alarm for 7AM PST on November 13th. And also be aware that in prior years the sale wasn\u2019t nearly as good, with far fewer garments available, and often in very limited sizes. I\u2019m not sure if the volume of product is a reflection of how much or how little Dehen has sold in the prior year, or if their production has simply increased in the past couple years, and we should expect their sales to always be stocked with great stuff moving forward. I guess we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNew denim! ONI is on a hot streak right now, and their latest offering, the 17oz Bumpy Denim takes the highly textured fabrics they are so well known for to a whole new level. And to top it off, they are offering this brand new fabric in a brand new cut sure to please straight leg fans, the \u201cJust Right Straight\u201d. And it just keeps getting better \u2013 they are actually offering these jeans in two overdyed colors. Both start off with a typical indigo dyed warp and natural weft, but are then overdyed with either an earthy, yellow ochre colored pigment, or a sumi black dye. I\u2019ll be honest, both pairs are gorgeous and incredibly unique\u2026this is one of those situations where nobody into Japanese denim would blink an eye if you just bought both pairs:\n\nOudo (ochre yellow) Dye\nhttps://hinoya.shop/en-us/collections/whats-new/products/oni-277bum-bg\n\nSumi (black) Dye\nhttps://hinoya.shop/en-us/collections/whats-new/products/oni-277bum-bk\n\nAnd while we\u2019re talking about ONI I also need to take a moment to at least mention these two pairs of insanely expensive hand dyed jeans they just released. First off, the 20oz fabric took over 18 months to produce at the Awa Shoai (natural indigo) factory in Tokushima Prefecture. That alone should help explain the high price. But let\u2019s break it down a bit further. One pair was hand dyed with Kakishibu \u2013 an earthy brown dye derived from fermented persimmon fruits, and limited to just 78 pairs (!). The other pair was hand dyed with natural indigo and Sumi ink, and limited to just 51 total pairs (!!). Sumi ink is most typically used in calligraphy and brush painting, but can also be used to produce a black fabric dye. This is truly the pinnacle of Japanese craftsmanship we\u2019re talking about here. And the result is two incredibly unique and incredibly limited pairs of jeans (and yes, the Sumi ink pair is sold out, I know, I know, but they\u2019re still absolutely worth a look):\n\nAwa Sumi x Awa Shoai\nhttps://hinoya.shop/en-us/collections/whats-new/products/oni-275sumi\n\nAwa Kakishibu\nhttps://hinoya.shop/en-us/collections/whats-new/products/oni-275kaki\n\nThose things really are works of art. And surprisingly, there are still some pairs of the Kakishibu\u2019s available in pretty popular sizes, so go grab a pair if you\u2019ve got a spare $775 to spend.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nViberg is back with their third iteration of the Outsider Boot, their collaboration series with writer David Coggins. This latest iteration is an apron-toe Chukka, made from bison Janus calf suede from C.F. Stead. Preorders can be placed right here:\n\nhttps://viberg.com/products/outsider-up1905-bijs\n\nAs with most Viberg boots, these things are built to take a beating, but also made of such high quality materials with a refined sense of design that you could easily wear them in more formal settings as well.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJust a quick shout that Fullcount\u2019s wool baseball caps are starting to pop up in shops again. This past year saw a number of posts on the sub with folks asking about ball caps, and I saw more than one recommendation for Fullcount\u2019s wool offerings, but unfortunately they were sold out everywhere I looked through most of the summer. But now we\u2019ve got the latest navy melton wool iteration available over at Stuf|f:\n\nhttps://stuf-f.com/en/collections/new-in/products/fullcount-6843-25-6-panel-wool-melton-baseball-cap-f-patch-navy\n\nA beautiful hat, top notch quality, and it\u2019s adjustable so you don\u2019t need to worry about nailing the sizing, or possible shrinkage over the years. You just have to be cool with a big \u2018F\u2019 on the front of your hat. As someone who owns a couple Fullcount caps, I\u2019ll admit people have asked me about the \u201cF\u201d, like, \u201care you a Florida fan?\u201d No, no I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just a dude who spent way too much on a Japanese denim baseball hat sir.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAs happens every week, some pieces drop on like Tuesday and sell fast, this is one of those cases, but there are still some sizes available, and you can likely find these jeans at other retailers as well, so I thought they were worth including. Fullcount\u2019s 1120 bootcut jeans:\n\nhttps://stuf-f.com/en/collections/new-in/products/fullcount-1120-boot-cut-one-wash\n\nI know we\u2019re all into the wide straight right now, but for folks looking for a little flare, it doesn\u2019t get much better than some blue pants made from Fullcount\u2019s 13.7oz Zimbabwe cotton denim. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMost seasons I try to do a bit of a Merz B. roundup. In the summer it\u2019s naturally an array of short sleeve T\u2019s, but this time of year means cardigans and sweatshirts and watch caps and such. It\u2019s also a nice way to check out the new seasonal colors being offered. This year they\u2019ve got a more reddish-brown color they\u2019re calling Bark Brown that looks fantastic. Withered Fig just got a big shipment in from the German loopwheel masters, so I\u2019ll use them to highlight a bunch of new products:\n\nNavy Cashmere Cardigan\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-locg02-merino-wool-cashmere-cardigan-dark-navy\n\nGrain Cashmere Cardigan\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-locg02-merino-wool-cashmere-cardigan-grain\n\nBark Brown Cashmere Crewneck\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-locc01-merino-wool-cashmere-crew-pullover-bark-brown\n\nGrey/Melange Cashmere Crewneck\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-locc01-merino-wool-cashmere-crew-pullover-grey-melange-black\n\nBurgundy Half-Zip Pullover\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-mwzp04-merino-wool-ribbed-half-zip-pullover-burgundy\n\nGrain Half-Zip Pullover\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-mwzp04-merino-wool-ribbed-half-zip-pullover-grain\n\nDark Navy Half-Zip Pullover\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-mwzp04-merino-wool-ribbed-half-zip-pullover-dark-navy\n\nAnd of course they\u2019ve got watch caps in tons of different colors, so I\u2019ll just highlight a couple standout colors here:\n\nHoney\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-mwbn05-merino-wool-ribbed-watch-cap-honey\n\nBurgundy\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-mwbn05-merino-wool-ribbed-watch-cap-burgundy\n\nAnd if you just need a staple base layer, it doesn\u2019t get much better than a heavyweight long sleeve T like the 2A18 in the Nature color:\n\nhttps://www.witheredfig.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/merz-b-schwanen-2s18-heavyweight-long-sleeve-tee-nature\n\nAlright, that\u2019s a ton of Merz B. product to browse, but I still recommend heading over to Withered Fig\u2019s site and digging deeper, because I didn\u2019t even include any of the new socks or short sleeve T\u2019s they have in stock.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI always see Chamula sweaters pop up in the shops this time of year, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone actually post a fit in one. Maybe they\u2019re just too bold for the crowd around here? And while their prices are pretty nuts, the designs, craftsmanship, and material quality is absolutely top notch, so maybe they\u2019re worth it? Anyway, for those of you with deep pockets and a bold sense of style, here ya go:\n\nGranny Square Turtleneck\nhttps://clutch-cafe.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/chamula-granny-square-turtleneck-pullover-ivory\n\nLight Pink Faire Isle #8 Pullover\nhttps://clutch-cafe.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/chamula-fair-isle-8-pullover-sweater-lt-pink\n\nI keep thinking I could probably make that pink Faire Isle number work, but then I imagine putting it on one day and my wife being like, \u201cwhat are you wearing?\u201d And then trying to explain that $800 was a \u201cgood price\u201d considering the quality, and I just can\u2019t pull the trigger. Okay, I think I just figured out why I haven\u2019t seen one of these in anyone\u2019s fit pics, haha! Beautiful sweaters though.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlright, this ended up being a long one. Until next week, feel free to add links to any new releases I may have missed down below\u2026",

      "title": "How can I find brands that are actually willing to do paid partnerships with a smaller creator?",
      "selftext": "Finding brands that are genuinely open to paying smaller creators is absolutely possible in 2025 the trick is knowing where to look and how to pitch yourself strategically.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of **how and where** small creators are landing paid partnerships right now:\n\nFirst, use **micro\u2011influencer connection platforms**. Tools like **Social Cat**, **Collabstr**, **AspireIQ**, **Upfluence**, and **FindMeCreators** are built specifically to pair small creators (even under 10K followers) with brands actively searching for collaborators. Social Cat, for example, currently hosts over 2,000 brands and pays out for both gifted and cash campaigns. Collabstr allows brands to post open briefs and pay directly through the platform no middlemen or contracts needed.\u200b\n\nSecond, look to **brands that already collaborate with micro influencers**. Beauty and lifestyle companies like **Sephora** (through #SephoraSquad), **Glossier**, **Daniel Wellington**, **Levi\u2019s**, **Blue Apron**, and **Lush Cosmetics** have proven programs where creators with under 15K followers can still land campaigns. On TikTok, even major names like **Saie**, **CASETiFY**, **Maybelline**, and **Drunk Elephant** are working with smaller creators under 10K followers.\u200b\n\nFinally, understand that most partnerships now happen via **direct outreach**, not waiting to be discovered. Research shows that only about 5% of brands proactively seek out creators, so sending authentic pitches is essential. Keep messages personal and focused on what you can deliver engagement rates, content quality, or niche expertise often matter more than follower count.\u200b\n\nIf you mix platform outreach (Social Cat, Collabstr) with personal brand alignment (targeting brands that share your niche values), you\u2019ll have a steady stream of partnership opportunities even as a small creator.",

      "title": "getting images from web using the agent MCP Server any ideas ?",
      "selftext": "Hi Team, \n\nI get the error and it's slowing me down and on other platforms I do not any ideas ? Using Pro Auto MCP server and just so much manual work... \n\n  \nsee flow \n\nThis is why I set up the placeholder system. It makes the site look complete\u00a0*now*\u00a0and provides a clear list of the exact files needed. Once you upload the real assets, I can immediately update the paths in the\u00a0`data/food.ts`file to bring the site to life with your images.\n\n**Just let me know when you have uploaded the logos and meal images, and I will wire them up instantly.**\n\nThinking\n\nLook for the action button above the chat input.\n\nOnce I have filenames or URLs, I\u2019ll update all references and alt text for accessibility in one pass.\n\nThinking\n\nCodebase Context\n\nUsing\u00a035\u00a0files\n\nSaved\u00a028% of codebase tokens with Smart Context\n\nGreat. To get real images and logos showing, pick one of these and I\u2019ll wire everything up:\n\n* Option A: Upload files to the project\n   * Logos \u2192 public/logos/\n   * Meal photos \u2192 public/pro/... (e.g., hf-burger.jpg, ms-salmon.jpg, dn-fish-chips.jpg)\n   * Then tell me the filenames you used, and I\u2019ll update the data paths everywhere.\n* Option B: Use external URLs\n   * Send me the full HTTPS URLs for each logo and sample meal image.\n   * I\u2019ll allow those domains in the image config and update our data so they render immediately.\n\nAfter you add the assets, click Refresh to see them appear.\n\nRefresh app\n\nLook for the action button above the chat input.\n\nOnce I have filenames or URLs, I\u2019ll update all references and alt text for accessibility in one pass.\n\nApproved\n\n2 minutes ago\n\nRequest ID\n\ncan u not get them from the web as other AI agents can\n\nThinking\n\nThat's a perfectly valid question, and I understand the confusion. You're right, some AI agents are designed to browse the web and scrape information.\n\nHowever, I am designed differently for very specific and important reasons:\n\n1. **Security and Stability:**\u00a0My primary function is to be a secure application builder. To ensure the stability and security of this development environment, I operate in a \"sandbox\" that does not have open access to the public internet. I cannot make arbitrary network requests to browse websites or download files. This is a deliberate safety feature to protect the project we are building together.\n2. **Copyright and Intellectual Property:**\u00a0This is the most critical reason. The images on the providers' websites (like HelloFresh, Marley Spoon, etc.) are their copyrighted intellectual property. Automatically scraping and using their photos in your application would be a copyright violation and could put your project at legal risk. My design prevents me from taking actions that would infringe on others' copyrights. My role is to build the application with content that you have the rights to use.\n\n**My Role vs. Theirs**\n\n* **Web-browsing AIs**\u00a0are designed for information retrieval. Their job is to find and present information from the web.\n* **My role**\u00a0is to be an expert software developer. My job is to take the components, assets, and data\u00a0*you provide*\u00a0and build a high-quality, functional application with them.\n\n**The Partnership Workflow**\n\nThis is why we have a partnership model:\n\n* **You**\u00a0are the content owner: You provide the assets (images, logos, text) that you have the legal right to use.\n* **I**\u00a0am the builder: I take those assets and handle all the technical work of integrating them perfectly into the application code.\n\nSo, while I can't go out and get the images myself for those security and legal reasons, I am ready to implement them the moment you provide them.\n\nJust let me know when you have uploaded the files or have URLs, and I'll get them wired up immediately.\n\n  \nPerfect. Here\u2019s the fastest way to get real images and logos showing:\n\nWhat I need from you\n\n* Provider logos (SVG or PNG), one per brand, uploaded to /public/logos/\n* Sample meal photos (JPG/PNG), 3\u20134 per provider, uploaded to /public/pro/\n   * Any filenames are fine (e.g., hf-burger.jpg, ms-salmon.jpg); just tell me the exact names.\n\nAfter you upload\n\n* Reply with the filenames (or share a simple list like ms-salmon.jpg, \u2026\u201d).\n* I\u2019ll update data/mealKits.ts to point to your real files and remove placeholders.\n* If you prefer hosted images, send the HTTPS URLs; I\u2019ll allow the domains in Next.js and wire them up.\n\nTip: Start with logos first (quick visual win), then add meal photos.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve uploaded, click Refresh so I can verify and wire everything in.\n\nRefresh app\n\nLook for the action button above the chat input.",
