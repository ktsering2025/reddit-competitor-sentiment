      "text": "I am in Canada if that makes any difference. I have been getting Hellofresh regularly for about 5 months now. It is super convenient and helps me eat less takeout. \n\nA few months ago, they mentioned they were going to increase the quality of their meat, which I thought was great. Their meat was never terrible to me (it was fine). Not high quality, but still fine. However, since about a month ago, I have found their meat to be quite awful, particularly the ground meat (including sausage). It seems to be filled with a lot of filler or something because it reminds me almost of hot dogs if they were ripped into pieces, but ofc, the taste is not the same as hot dogs but it also doesn't taste like it should. I have never experienced this with ground meats that I purchased elsewhere... \n\nI am definitely going to cancel next month (my partner asked we do it for the next month as we are busy) and, in the meantime, avoid the ground meats but it is unfortunate because they are often in quicker meals. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Or willing to pay attention? ",

And another one that was like 'Meals with a Purpose' or something like that.  And when they have these, I wonder what the theme is, etc.  Like I saw Kevin's Chili, I assume there are other, similar meals?\n\nWhen my kids were younger, there were a few collections that we really liked.  It was always fun to try the new items to change it up.  There was a Guardians of the Galaxy thing, and I believe we got every meal, because there was some sort of collectible in them.\n\nDoes anyone know where we can read about the new collections?

After I groused and yelled and got a supervisor, the company said they'd put the amount of the missing meal back on my gift card, refunded the double billing to my debit card, and that I could resume my experience.\n\nThen the third week happened.\n\nI don't even have resolution yet.  I got an email stating they've cancelled my account and cancelled my delivery for this week.  I haven't talked to customer service yet, but you can believe they're about to get an earful.

I created an account, selected my meals and breakfast add on and applied the code. Then I noticed something strange. The breakfast add on is still being charged full price. Talked to support and they told me I need to manually select the add on since it's not added automatically. Well that's what I did. It was very clear this support person didn't even read my issue properly. From looking at the posts here, it seems the free breakfast is on a different tab, but I never saw it- hence my immense confusion. The dodgy answer from support also didn't help.\n\nRegardless I asked them to cancel my order and my subscription. No thanks. Hope y'all are enjoying this but  it isn't worth it for me.",

      "text": "\nTLDR; how do I get a box that I forgot to skip refunded after it shows up? Just call in and tell them half the ingredients were rotten? Tell them they forgot to put ice in the box? Tell them none of the meat was in there? Dispute it on my credit card? I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s unethical. Read below if you wanna know what lead to me being this discontent with them.  \n\nHey there, I\u2019m greatly disappointed with HelloFresh\u2019s customer service level. I signed me and my wife up for 4 meals a week under the free caraway pan promo. I understand that you are eligible for the pan after your 3rd box and a redemption code will be sent to your email within 14 days after receiving the 3rd box.\n\nI started the subscription 8 weeks ago. I bought the first 5 boxes when when I still hadn\u2019t got a code I decided to pause until I received my promo so I had skipped what would be the 6th and 7th box and reached out twice over email asking about the caraway code. The first email never got a response, the second email literally said nothing other than the phone number to call into support. I tried to call but it was out of office hours so I didn\u2019t speak to anyone. I\u2019ve been working a lot lately so it fell to the back of my mind for a couple days as I planned on calling them later on. Well then I seen a charge notification go through on my Apple Pay. This was for the next box (what would be #8) I will admit that I forgot to skip it on my end. The charge took place around midnight so the phone line was closed but I made sure to reach out to them at 8am the following morning. The lady asked me why I wanted to skip and I told her that I meant to skip because 1. I haven\u2019t received my pan promo I signed up for 2. Because since it was meant to be skipped we didn\u2019t go select the meals and due to my wife dietary restrictions 2 or the 4 meals that were auto selected wouldn\u2019t be useable for us anyways. \n\nShe then told me they are getting more pan codes and that I should have one soon but to call back in 3-5 days if I haven\u2019t got it yet, well ok. Now I will say she was very nice on the phone but when moved we onto the box I was trying to cancel she told me that it couldn\u2019t be done because the box was already made?! (Keep in mind this was on Thursday morning and my box shows up Monday so I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a lie. I expressed that it\u2019s wild that they force me be ok with it when I reached out less than 12 hours after the charge and the box is still days away from being shipped but when It comes to them being weeks late on my pan I\u2019m suppose to just be alright with a sorry and continue to wait on the premise \u201cwe we get it to you eventually\u201d. She apologized but restated there was nothing she could do other than bring up my feedback. I told her I just wanted my pan and that outside of that I would be canceling my service with them. How to do get my money back on this box? I understand I\u2019m a fault for not skipping it in time but there should have been some sort of resolution available other than tough luck, especially given that I\u2019ve been patient with them not holding up their end of the bargain on my promo.

I'm mostly just looking for one that is maybe a bit on the cheaper side, but obviously still good quality.\n\nAlso portion, depends on the price, but I've heard some meal kits have really small portions, which I would like to avoid if I can. I know there isn't some amazing meal kit thats dirt cheap, but I would like to learn about different meal kits before deciding about one.\n\nNot ready made or ready made, either one is fine.",

      "title": "CookUnity over Factor (unsolicited)",
      "text": "Background:  I\u2019m a man in my 30\u2019s from the Midwest U.S (many comments on quality seem to mention location playing a role). I wanted a better lunch experience for days I go into the office, but I get fatigued picking out all the different ingredients to keep it interesting when grocery shopping. Buying lunch each day is expensive and the same frozen meals every day is boring. I\u2019m not a DoorDash/uber eats user, so I am not replacing that cost. If you are, this definitely will save you money. I was looking for healthier, better tasting, more various and relatively affordable options for lunch. Maybe a dinner here and there. I tried these companies starting 1/2025.\n\nI\u2019ve had 24 CookUnity meals and 16 factor meals. I have eaten them fresh as well as from frozen. I\u2019ve tried their premium meals (overall not worth the up charge with either company in my opinion). I\u2019ve cooked them in a microwave, air fryer and oven. Eaten them for lunch and dinner (eating truffled fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken from CookUnity for dinner as I type this out), and just got my first breakfast meal options in my most recent order. \n\nI stick with Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Salmon for proteins. \n\nAll in all, CookUnity is a far better experience. \n\nFactor is not terrible and can be better than or atleast a nice change of pace from grocery store frozen or premade meals. So, definitely place an order, get those discount and some free goodies that only factor offers (little juice shots)\n\nWhat I Like about CookUnity:\nQuality- The quality of food is just better with CookUnity. It\u2019s fresher, better texture, and seems like a meal someone would make at home or\u2026even a restaurant. Factor meals seemed less fresh or maybe poorly sourced, the flavor was all from toppings not marinating, and just basic.\n\nVariety: CookUnity has so many different ingredients they use in various dishes. Their chefs take flavors from all over the world and pair them with sides or veggies that fit the theme. Factor just has like \u201cHey! here\u2019s this protein and this side that we have in the inventory that probably go together\u201d\n\nVeggies/Sides/ Variety (continued): The sides really made a difference. CookUnity has Chopped or whole veggies like broccoli, leafy greens, red onions, asparagus, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower\u2026 they have sides like mashed potatoes, red potatoes, Mac n cheese, noodles, and toppings/ sauces in little containers. If you are looking for healthy, you can avoid this stuff, but I freaking love me some sour cream or a side of Mac n cheese. Factor had pretty much the same game plan every time ; Cauliflower rice as a base for their protein and a side of easily microwaveable veggies like broccoli or green beans. And instead of little sauces or toppings, most meals came with a little \u201cbutter scoop\u201d(like those ones at restaurants that sorta look like ice cream\u2026 yes\u2026 I did that once also) of a topping that would melt and disperse over the food as it heated. It usually just soaks into the cauliflower rice making it more mushy.\n\nCooking/ Packaging: they both come in single serving containers, but that\u2019s what we are here for. CookUnity containers are compostable material, while Factor comes in plastic. This means it less environmentally friendly, less healthy after heating (plastics), and more limited. CookUnity meals can be made in the ways I mentioned in my 1st paragraph (don\u2019t put the CookUnity container in a AirFryer unless you have good insurance!), while Factor, due to the sloppy base of cauliflower rice, can really only be heated in the microwave. CookUnity even gives directions for oven and microwave. CookUnity is delivered in a reusable bag that the delivery person with pick up when delivering your next order. Factor is a big box with a cooling pad and insulation lining.\n\nAdvice:\nBe adventurous!: A huge value here is adding variety and eating meals you might never make yourself, so take advantage of that!\n\nThat said, have some guidelines. Stick to proteins you know you will like or look for atleast one ingredient you know you know you will like even if the rest of the dish is a mystery. With factor, always choose whole proteins. Their diced or sliced proteins always tend be mushy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the meal, call the company and tell them!!! They will credit you the cost of the meal almost every time. Both companies have pretty friendly customer service teams.\n\nTake Advantage of your discounts!: Order as many meals as makes sense based on pricing, especially for CookUnity. Maybe not factor, but that\u2019s my biased, which is everything so far anyways. After so many meals in an order, they start to go up in price due to shipping and the company not wanting to get totally burned. I\u2019ve found that 14-18 meals gives you the best price point. Sure, from frozen is never better than from fresh, but if you are already eating frozen meals, that\u2019s a non-factor.\n\nPause your order: unless you plan to eat all those meals in a week, you will want to pause your order. If not, they will send you another shipment next week, with or without you selecting meals.\n\nYes, pause your order before canceling. Especially if you are brand hopping. Most of the companies will offer you more discounts when you try to cancel. If you are brand hopping, use their initial discounts while pause the companies you\u2019ve already used. Once you\u2019ve cycled through all the companies you want to try, go back and cancel the 1st one you went to, take the discount and stock up again! You can make these discounts last a really long time if you do this.\n\nBe sorta thoughtful about which meals might freeze better than others. When I get my order, I immediately freeze a large portion and keep a few in my fridge for the upcoming week. Example, I don\u2019t think leafy greens freeze well, so I eat those 1st. I think they will all freeze and reheat fine, but, maybe give it some consideration.\n\nI am not paid by CookUnity on anything, just really happy I found them. But hey, if someone at CookUnity sees this, I\u2019m totally down to write more reviews in exchange for discounts! Comment below!\n\nI have not tried any of the others: Tempo by homechef, hello fresh\u2019s or blue apron\u2019s new line or the few others out there. I also have not tried the packaged meals from HelloFresh or Blue Apron. I think I might give HelloFresh and Blue Apron a try in the future once I\u2019m done getting all I can out of these companies. They have been around awhile and I have heard decent things about them or been recommended by friend to try their packaged meals. If anyone wants to build some callouses on their fingers and give me a run down on those groups, please do.\n\nMaybe, I\u2019ll come back with more info and edit or comment later, but that\u2019s all I can think of for now. \n\nThanks for coming to my T.E.D talk.",

Are there any meal services like HelloFresh with options to deliver just once a week (in the US)?\n\nI really love cooking and value finding and cooking recipes on my own, but I typically end up having to rely on frozen meals a couple times a week due to time. I am pretty slow at prepping ingredients because I\u2019m a chemist so I\u2019m wayyyyy too specific about measurements. I\u2019ve tried to break that habit and speed tf up, but I\u2019m a lost cause. I end up not having enough time to cook meals to last through the week.\n\nI think I would really enjoy having 1 meal kit per week to fill in the gaps. From what I understand, most meal kits come with pre-prepped ingredients. This would save me a ton of time if I were to add another day of cooking to my week. Unfortunately, I am struggling to find a service that offers just 1 meal/week. I know I\u2019d waste the food if I was on a 2 meal/week plan.\n\nI know I could potentially freeze the meals I\u2019m not eating with a 2/week plan, but I just don\u2019t want to lol. ",

      "title": "Honest Review of Hungryroot",
      "text": "To preface this post - I am a former HelloFresh customer, I paid for HelloFresh for over a year but the recipes are limited after so long and the cook/prep time took too long. I switched to Hungryroot in mid-December and have received three boxes from them. \n\nI'll be breaking down this review into three parts 1.Meal and grocery options 2.Time/Prep 3.Cost.\n\n1. Meal and Grocery options 8/10\nI have no dietary restrictions that require me to use Hungryroot, since they largely advertise being a better option for people with restrictions. For someone without restrictions who wants to live/eat healthier the meal options are great. I enjoy the organic part of the service, grass fed and sustainability sourced meats and in three boxes I havent had an issue with the quality of produce. The produce comes extremely fresh, and the card included in the subscription gives you use-by dates on all of the meat and produce. I struggle with creating recipes which is why I choose meal kits over grocery shopping, their recipes have overall been tasty and very simple. I enjoy the grocery part of the service, I live a \"grab and go\" life when it comes to breakfast and they have plenty of pre-made options for my lifestyle. The snacks are good as well, but I find myself picking from the kids section for those.\n\n2. Time/ Prep 10/10\nThis was a very large aspect of switching for me, HelloFresh recipes took a very long time to cook despite their 20 minutes or less options. I have yet to cook a Hungryroot meal that takes me longer than 30 minutes. In my last box I ordered a lot of \"bowls\" the vegetables for these options came pre-sliced and packaged which is incredibly convenient. They have a variety of options for pre-cooked meats that are heat and eat, but I've largely avoided these out of fear. \n\n3. Cost 2/10\nThis is the reason I am canceling my Hungryroot subscription. That probably wasn't what you were expecting at the end of this review, but it's very evident the service overcharges. I've subscribed to Factor, HomeChef and HelloFresh in the past by far Hungryroot is the most expensive for a single person. Their meals and groceries are based off of a point system, so you never actually see how much you are paying for itmes. I paid $150/week for one person, focusing my subscription on dinners and breakfast since these are the only two meals I eat during the day. I decided to do a cost breakdown on how much it would be to purchase everything from Walmart that I received in my first box, the cost went from $150 to $102. There isn't a huge price gap, however, the quanity purchased from a grocery store is much different than a meal subscription service. For the cost of 8oz of Italian sausage through Hungryroot I could buy 1lb from Walmart and have multiple meals. I understand that subscription services are meant as a convenience, so we expect to pay extra, but in my opinion Hungryroot isn't worth it for the quanity you receive. \n\nHopefully this review was clear, I'm open to answering any questions on the service or the others I have mentioned in this post!

      "text": "I finally pulled up the plug on HelloFresh after two years and I\u2019m on the hunt for a new meal kit service. I like cooking and making the food myself so readymade meals are not for me. The biggest factor for me is cost. I was able to keep my hellofresh subscription around $65-75 a week for 2 meals (4 servings) with the student discount. Unfortunately my discount ran out and the quality overall has been downhill for a while. \n \nI\u2019d like to avoid all of the companies under the HelloFresh umbrella (ie: greenchef, everyplate, chef\u2019s plate, factor) \n \n \nSo far I have gathered that Blue Apron and Marleyspoon are the top choices people recommend. I\u2019d appreciate honest feedback and experiences with both companies and any other similar services. And while I understand that meal kits will inevitably cost more than grocery shopping and making meals on my own, I often pay the ADHD tax when I purchase my own groceries and benefit from a subscription that helps me plan ahead.

I\u2019m wanting to find a meal delivery service that gives me healthy (using mostly whole ingredients, not super processed) meal options I can keep in the freezer and pop in the oven on those really busy days that our baby can eat as well. We tried Hello Fresh when I was postpartum but found them to be pretty time consuming/difficult to put together with all the different ingredients. Anyone found a delivery meal service that tastes good, uses whole ingredients, but is easier to assemble than Hello Fresh?",

Overall brings it a lot closer to GreenChef's offering, but with the better # servings options.  ",

      "text": "Greetings ya'll. I'm considering either a meal kit service like Hello Fresh, Green Chef, or even Factor's ready made stuff. We're also considering something like misfit market. Anyway, here's our situation. We're a family of 3, me wife and 8 yr old boy. Life gets pretty busy for us between my owning and operating a small business, her having the home to take care of, a part time job, and pretty substantial ADHD. That being said, we can afford groceries just fine, but we live an hour away from any supermarket, and groceries in our little town are god awfully expensive. So when we do shop, it's $400+ and a good portion of it goes to waste.\n\nThe waste is in part due to her ADHD. She'll forget what we have or let stuff get buried in the back of the fridge, or just go wild cooking and cook too much. I love left overs and grew up in a home where we basically fought over them, not out of poorness, but for love of mama's cooking. Some times she just cooks that much.\n\nI know the simplest answers would be\n\n\"keep better track of what you're buying\"\n\n\"Try a written out meal prep plan\"\n\n\"Just don't cook too much\"\n\nRespectfully, I know! But it's just not working out for us. So, what are your recommendations on a decent meal kit or food delivery service? We make pretty good money, so it doesn't have to be the cheapest option, but the whole point is to spend less in the big picture, so not the best of the best. We do eat with general health in mind, but aren't strict dieters. Ideally, we prefer to eat minimal processed foods, minimal food dyes and such, but aren't afraid of bacon and butter (In moderation of course and typically not together)\n\nCheers and thank you all",

Comparatively, HR is terrible. The food quality, the recipes, the way the instructions are printed \u2014 it\u2019s all subpar compared to EveryPlate and Hello Fresh. They send full bags of ingredients for one recipe. Why am I getting a full package of sliced cheese for two cheeseburgers\u2026? They also send other companies\u2019 products. If I wanted Kevin\u2019s pre-cooked chicken, I\u2019d have just gone to Costco. The recipes we\u2019ve had instructed us to maybe heat up a couple things in the microwave and brown the protein in a pan. The other 2 boxed plans send ingredients and you get to ACTUALLY cook (make your own sauces, pickle your own vegetables, etc.). This feels like a huge scam and we\u2019ll both be cancelling. It isn\u2019t worth it for the money. Spend elsewhere.",

I couldn\u2019t decide between them so because they were not premium and they both had the same time it would take and the same difficulty level, I got both. I may end up regretting that by the end of Sunday when I do the second one.\n\nI thought this was pretty good, especially the rice, probably in part because it contained the drippings from the chicken. The chicken itself was pretty good, with seasoning it at the beginning with a combo of garlic powder and salt and then towards the end, basting it with some sweet soy glaze. I think it took me about an hour and 45 minutes total, but a lot of that was waiting for things to cook, especially the chicken. I\u2019m not sure it needed 3 sauces but fortunately, there was only one that was cooked, ginger scallion sauce, though I didn\u2019t particularly like it. I didn\u2019t think this recipe was particularly hard, though it\u2019s labeled as such, just involved and it took awhile to cook as half chickens typically do\n\nI really recommend this recipe\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of the first serving, with the leg part\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhsvxj4tonvf1.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfd8eb6dbe55532e9d7ff354855a721ceb619f86",

I put some of the mac and cheese on the burger.

      "title": "Quality rant from 7 year customer",
      "text": "Want to start off by saying that I obviously enjoy using Hellofresh, having been a customer since 2018. When I got my first place a couple of years ago, Hellofresh was super useful to mitigate some of the stress of moving in and figuring out what to cook. I also greatly improved my cooking ability over the years thanks to the recipes.\n\nWhich makes it all the more sad to see the current state of things. I read their latest available annual report where they suggest that they\u2019re trying to increase revenue of recurring (aka loyal) customers through up charges like marketplace and premium meals. \n\nI remember when premium meals were first introduced, and they legitimately felt \u201cpremium\u201d given the volume and quantity of food you receive. Things like the salmon Wellington for example were quite elaborate and felt unique. Nowadays half the options are premium, often times completely inexplicably. I don\u2019t understand how adding 3 strips of bacon to an otherwise typical meal justifies a $10 up charge. I understand that they barely increased the base box prices over almost a decade, but honestly I would rather the base increase than have every decent looking meal be an upcharge. \n\nThe ingredient quantity and quality has also plummeted. The meat I receive is just plain gross to the point that I absolutely dread opening the meat packets. I\u2019m actually in awe every time I buy grocery store ground beef and notice the pleasant smell and lack of sliminess compared to what HF is sending. And we all know about the \u201cshredded chicken\u201d scraps they send by now.\n\nThere are also notable omissions from recipes when you compare to years ago. One easy example is the salsas that come with Mexican dishes - often times the \u201csalsa\u201d is just a diced up tomato soaked in lime juice. In years past they\u2019d set you up with a full pico de gallo.\n\nThen there\u2019s small details which aren\u2019t super relevant, but cheapen the overall experience. Lately I\u2019ve been getting TreStelle \u201ccream cheese product\u201d instead of actual cream cheese. I would never buy and ingest this junk on my own volition, yet I use it through HF. Honey and vinegar used to come in miniature bottles, now they\u2019re just blank transparent packets. Not the end of the world, but kind of crummy for a meal kit that used to be positioned as the premium option.\n\nEven though the menu is multiple times bigger than what it used to be years ago, it is substantially harder to decide on 3-5 meals that aren\u2019t just week to week repeats. Also, they decided to pollute the menu options with factor meals - if I wanted to order factor, I\u2019d order factor. They should at minimum be tucked away behind a tab like the marketplace items.\n\nAnyway, I just felt like sharing my perspective on what I see as a major degradation in a once amazing service. I hope that they can recover but it\u2019s surely not easy in these economic times.",

      "title": "Blue Apron v. Hello Fresh",
      "text": "I\u2019m posting this comparison in both Blue Apron and Hello Fresh subs. I get both meal kits delivered alternating weeks and have used the services for three months. Hello Fresh (HF) delivers to me on Saturday, and Blue Apron (BA) on Friday.\u00a0 I enjoy both and will continue to get both because they have different strengths. I am single and order two meals per week, and they last for a minimum of four dinners.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSingle? Blue Apron or both, like me!\n\nFamily?\u00a0 Hello Fresh\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Overall Winner: Hello Fresh**\u00a0\n\n**Recipe Quality**\n\nFresh meats and veggies from both.\n\nHF offers more family-friendly foods with the same base: chicken, pork, potato wedges, mashed potatoes, and broccoli.\n\nBA offers much fancier recipes with unusual ingredients \u2013 perfect for impressing a date or cooking together. I love eating fancy foods with flair!\n\nWinner: BA\n\n**Number of recipes**\n\nHands down, HF offers far more recipes.\u00a0 For 3/15/25, there are approximately 62 meals, six of those are prepared microwaveable meals, and three are prep and bake.\n\nBA offers 20 options. Two are ready to cook, and none are microwaveable.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Premium meals**\n\nBecause HF offers many more meals, more are premium than BA. From my experience, all of the meals involving fish are considered premium and cost more (approximately $9 more per serving). BA routinely includes fish in its base price (shrimp, codfish, tilapia, and salmon) and I love fish and not having to pay extra for it with BA.\n\nLooking at the menu, BA offers only one premium meal: Duck Confit &amp; Coconut Curry Ramen, which costs $18.98 per serving.\u00a0\n\nHF has six premium meals, including Shoyu-Style Ramen with Sesame-Soy Salmon for 8.99 per service.\n\nThe recipes HF charges extra for would typically be part of BA\u2019s base plan.\u00a0 I have not ordered premium meals from either.\n\nWinner: Tie.\u00a0 HF is cheaper and has more options.\u00a0 But fish is standard fare for BA and is always offered.\n\n**Specialty Meals:**\n\nLooking for big-batch meals, casseroles, or slow-cooker options: HF.\u00a0 BA doesn\u2019t offer these.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Add ons:**\u00a0\n\nBoth have upsells after you\u2019ve selected your meals for the week, but HF has many more options: smoothies (sometimes sold out), breakfast items, and decadent desserts.\u00a0 I\u2019ve ordered desserts from HF twice: blueberry cake and hazelnut cheesecake.\u00a0 I ordered one and received two servings of each. The cake was microwaveable. Both were delicious but high in calories and fat, which isn\u2019t viewable online.\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Order correctness**\n\nThere have been no issues with HF yet. BA has sent me the wrong delivery once. I was looking forward to my salmon meal, too. Instead of one, I received three meals instead of two, including fried chicken, falafel salad, and chorizo enchiladas. I try to stay on the lighter side of calories, but of course, I made the dishes. BA responded quickly via email and refunded my meal for that week.\u00a0\n\nWinner:\u00a0 HF\n\n**Packaging**\u00a0\n\nI love HF\u2019s packaging!\u00a0 Both of my recipes come in separate brown paper bags. I can just open the box and pop the bags in the fridge.\u00a0 Look underneath the cardboard divider for meats and pop in the freezer.\u00a0\n\nBA just tosses all the individual ingredients in a box like: YOU figure it out!\u00a0\n\nI like that BA lets you know the ice product is sink-friendly.\u00a0 HF does not say that, so I toss the heavy packaging.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**App**\u00a0\n\nBoth apps are easy to navigate and have the recipes cards in the app in the event you lose yours.\u00a0 They both have filters so you can get to your low-calorie, vegetarian or Bestseller meals quickly. I like that HF's front menu page shows the calorie content.\u00a0\n\nWinner HF\u00a0\n\n**Repetitiveness**\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been using the services for three months and still haven\u2019t bought the same meal twice, although I easily could. Because HF has so many options, many are repeated often. The Honey Onion Crunch Chicken is almost always on the menu. That was my first dish, and it is an easy-to-make one-pan meal and delicious! I can\u2019t wait to have it again.\u00a0\n\nBA doesn\u2019t repeat meals as often, but its unique ingredients make regular appearances. So, it has multiple recipes that use the same ingredients in its stock.\n\nWinner: BA has less repetitive/boring recipes even if they reuse ingredients.\n\n**Affordability**\u00a0\n\nI order two meals each week from each (which is four meals). I think I\u2019m still getting a discount from HF and pay about $55. BA is $10-12 more. Sometimes, with HF, I order an extra microwaveable meal for about $8 (two meals). When my HF discount is over, I should be paying about $10 more.\u00a0\n\nBA is more expensive. But the quality of their food and recipes justify the price. I do wish they\u2019d spend money on brown paper bags for individual recipes like HF.\u00a0\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\n\n**Taste**\u00a0\n\nBoth have good meals, and I\u2019m saving all of my recipe cards in a binder and making notes on them (although you can save them in the app, too.)\u00a0 Nothing has been awful, just items I don\u2019t prefer: like lettuce wraps from HF.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, that\u2019s Blue Apron.\n\nWinner:\u00a0 BA\n\n",

The second picture shows how much sauce you have before you simmer it down, for one pound of spaghetti and two chicken cutlets. It was completely devoid of flavor because there was not enough sauce by a factor of like 75%. It needed more than triple the amount of sauce it had. It said to keep adding pasta water until it was creamy, but I was just watering down water sauce by that point. Horrible. Don\u2019t get this. It needed diced tomatoes too. HF used to give tomatoes with meals like this but now they don\u2019t. Meals like this are why I\u2019m skipping most weeks now.

      "text": "I've had this service for 2 to 3 years now and in the past 365 days, my weekly box has gone missing about 5 or 6 times. Not a lot, but there is a pattern. Every time my box goes missing it's through the same delivery partner, FarEye. UPS, FedEx, \\_Factor... all of them have never missed the mark, but FarEye has a really high failure rate for me specifically (been at the same address). From my POV here's what happens:\n\nI get a notification that my box is out for delivery and a tracking link, later I get a notification the box was devlivered, look on my porch and it isn't there, check the devlivery link and the picture the FarEye driver is required to take isn't even a picture of the box; it's usually a picture of them pointing their camera at a random house while they drive or a picture of the inside of their trunk. I leave a one-star report, call customer service and get refunded. \n\nSo, it all works out in the end, but the fact that it's only ever FarEye and my box goes missing, not because it was delivered to a wrong address (signified by a picture of my box on someone else's door-step), but because the person flat out did not deliver the box... it seems convenient in a non-tinfoil-hat way. It's my head cannon that maybe FarEye just has low hiring standards and maybe some people are like, hey, free food for me!",

      "title": "Cook Unity vs Factor -- My Observations",
      "text": "I purchase the meals that are under 650 calories and mostly only eat the seafood so this review will focus on mainly those meals.\n\nAt 59, I am so done with cooking and was looking for something easy, healthy, and lower in calories (am down 30 lbs since I started).\n\nI have had Cook Unity (CU) for nearly 6 months and have been very pleased.  I obviously live in a good area with a good local delivery service as I have never had any issues with packaging or delivery.  I have read comments that noted the delivery and packing were not good.  I live in northern Ohio and my meals come from New York.  They get dropped off to a local spot where drivers then deliver them on their assigned routes.  My local spot is about an hour from me and my meals have always been cold when they arrive.  \n\nI eat a lot of salmon and they have many different recipes -- different seasonings and different sauces -- so that it doesn't always seem like I am eating the same salmon over and over.  Same with the shrimp meals. I especially like the cold shrimp grain bowls (I LOVE farro and quinoa!).  In six months I have had one meal that I did not think was prepared very well -- overcooked falafel.  CU was very quick to issue me a credit toward my next meal so I was satisfied.  I simply emailed them and sent a pic of the meal.  So, only one 'bad' meal in six months is, to me, very good!\n\nI did try a few of the non-seafood meals and they weren't to my liking.  However, I love the seafood (or just vegetarian) meals and I find there is enough of a variety that I don't feel limited.\n\nMany times I halve the meals and add my own extras (cooked spinach, more grains, etc.) and can make the meal into 2 servings.  I eat 4 smaller meals a day and use the CU as one of my main meals so I am not looking for HUGE portions that would fill up a growing teen or adult male.  \n\n  \nI tried Factor for two weeks.  They deliver via FedEx so you are at their mercy.  They do indicate that the shipments could be a day later than your desired delivery date and that did happen to me once.  The way they pack them was good though and my meals stayed cold.  For those that complain they were left out in the hot sun -- what else is the FedEx (or any delivery person) going to to?  Bring them into your fridge?  For both CU and Factor, you can track your meals so you do know when they will arrive.  I make sure I am home so I can bring them inside as soon as they are delivered.  It's just common sense!\n\nFactor had a few beef meals that looked tasty so I tried them.  I am not a huge meat eater and do not eat 'chunks' of meat lol but I did try a few of their shredded beef dishes and they were both very good. Their smoke gouda shredded beef mac and cheese was fantastic!  Also, their egg bites were very very good!  I would cook some spinach and mushrooms and add an egg bite broken up into it for a full breakfast (the package comes with two).  \n\n  \nOverall, however, I feel the quality of CU is superior to Factor.  CU's shrimp are grilled and seasoned, whereas Factor simply throws pre-cooked shrimp (like you would buy at the grocery store) into whatever their shrimp dish is.  It's not cooked IN the dish or with any type of seasonings.  \n\nAlso, the sides (veggies generally) in Factor are more often just steamed, whereas CU will have at the least, a very tasty garlic butter or some kind of sauce with them.  I also like that CU packages their sauces separately in a small container because you can heat it up separately (or add it to the meal when it is closer to being cooked so it doesn't 'cook away'.  I don't get pasta dishes so I am not referring to that kind of sauce -- I mean the dill sauce or whatever that goes with like a salmon meal.\n\nOverall, if I had not had CU, I would be more satisfied with Factor but I feel CU's meals are more tasty.  I will still order Factor now and again but will definitely order CU much more often.  And, again, I can't speak for the chicken/beef/pork dishes, but as far as the seafood meals go, they are very tasty and anyone that says otherwise is not being honest.  I am very picky about my food!  I skipped a week once and went to the grocery store and bought the 'expensive' frozen single meals and couldn't even eat them they were so bland!\n\nI am going to be getting a Mighty Meals delivery next week and will compare that one as well.  I hope this has been helpful!!\n\n",

      "text": "Greetings ya'll. I'm considering either a meal kit service like Hello Fresh, Green Chef, or even Factor's ready made stuff. We're also considering something like misfit market. Anyway, here's our situation. We're a family of 3, me wife and 8 yr old boy. Life gets pretty busy for us between my owning and operating a small business, her having the home to take care of, a part time job, and pretty substantial ADHD. That being said, we can afford groceries just fine, but we live an hour away from any supermarket, and groceries in our little town are god awfully expensive. So when we do shop, it's $400+ and a good portion of it goes to waste.\n\nThe waste is in part due to her ADHD. She'll forget what we have or let stuff get buried in the back of the fridge, or just go wild cooking and cook too much. I love left overs and grew up in a home where we basically fought over them, not out of poorness, but for love of mama's cooking. Some times she just cooks that much.\n\nI know the simplest answers would be\n\n\"keep better track of what you're buying\"\n\n\"Try a written out meal prep plan\"\n\n\"Just don't cook too much\"\n\nRespectfully, I know! But it's just not working out for us. So, what are your recommendations on a decent meal kit or food delivery service? We make pretty good money, so it doesn't have to be the cheapest option, but the whole point is to spend less in the big picture, so not the best of the best. We do eat with general health in mind, but aren't strict dieters. Ideally, we prefer to eat minimal processed foods, minimal food dyes and such, but aren't afraid of bacon and butter (In moderation of course and typically not together)\n\nCheers and thank you all",

      "text": "Hi all!\n\nBackground: I live solo and have been using Factor for the past couple years. While I do find the service very useful and the meals generally pretty good, I did observe that it kind of made me dependent on them. I found that since I didn't _need_ to go to the store I would often just eat the Factor meals when I had them or otherwise just get fast food. I'd like to get myself to do actual cooking / use my oven more, and I'm hoping that being more comfortable with the cooking process and ingredients will make me less dependent on mealkit services. However, I want to ease into it so I don't just impulsively go back to *all* fast food.\n\nI had previously tried Home Chef once but struggled with the cooking part (despite it being simple, I am so green in the kitchen that it wasn't so easy). It didn't help that I'm a bit of a picky eater, and also that everything Home Chef offered was for two servings so I had to deal with leftovers. None of these were really major issues, but at the time I decided Factor would be a better fit.\n\nThat said I looked at Home Chef again recently and noticed that they have added a lot more option types to their menus, including sheet pan meals and also \"heat and eat\" meals like Factor. And overall I am thinking of making some life changes including giving cooking a more honest effort.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\nAm I able to combine all three meal types in a single box (standard, sheet pan, and heat/eat)? Further can I adjust box sizes on the fly as needed? These would be a huge advantage over Factor for what I'm looking for, so I could week by week decide what proportion of meals to have be ready to eat vs making myself (and not have to maintain two subscriptions like Factor + HelloFresh).\n\nHow does the cost structure compare to Factor? I tried to find pricing info on their site but it seems like you might have to get a ways into the setup process first. _Edit to add: I did find some cost info on their website after all, that said it doesn't go into a ton of detail on the different types / box sizes, so any insight from experience is appreciated!_\n\nWhat does order timing look like? With Factor you have to make selections by Wednesday night every week and if you miss it they'll just send you random stuff. They also delivered all meals on Tuesdays (though I later found that you could change the delivery date for like Sun-Wed I think). Is Home Chef similar? Which day is their order cutoff day for each week? (I assume delivery dates vary by area)\n\nWhere does Tempo fit into the mix? It seems like a separate service by the same company that is more of a direct competitor to Factor. Has this had an impact so far on Heat/Eat meals being available through Home Chef itself?\n\nThanks for any info you can provide! Also any other feedback on Home Chef is appreciated.",

I know that they're all advertising to be somewhat health-conscious, but even GreenChef manages to provide a meal with lots of protein and veggies that hits the 800-1000 calorie range. \n\nEven though the Factor and Tempo have dedicated \"&lt;500kcal\" categories, these are basically meaningless because virtually none of their meals are above 600kcal. That's somewhat reasonable for a quick lunch, but they also advertise this as an option for both lunch and dinner and specifically try to sell you huge quantities of meals (way more than services like HF let you select) at once. As a somewhat active man, two 500-600kcal meals a day are way too little, meaning that I'll either have to eat out, add in lots of snacks, or have multiple of their expensive meals at once. To be honest, I simply don't get why they can't add some more carbs or meat at the given price point to make the service attractive for more people, given that packaging/prep/shipping should make up the vast majority of their costs.

However, I\u2019m more than halfway through the meals that I ordered and they all just seem so bland. \nI\u2019m just wondering if maybe the quality has gone down or what other peoples opinions are I also got the free cookies for life when I signed up however, my cookie was smashed a bits from the packaging which also was not great. They said it would be delivered between 12 and eight on Sunday and I don\u2019t think it would have been cold and fresh had I not been home majority of the ice was kind of melted already. \n\nI\u2019ve made sure I\u2019ve paused it, but curious to know what some people\u2019s favorites are I tried to do a variety of Mexican-American Asian dishes with a protein and a carb or protein and veggie.

      "title": "CookUnity over Factor (unsolicited)",
      "text": "Background:  I\u2019m a man in my 30\u2019s from the Midwest U.S (many comments on quality seem to mention location playing a role). I wanted a better lunch experience for days I go into the office, but I get fatigued picking out all the different ingredients to keep it interesting when grocery shopping. Buying lunch each day is expensive and the same frozen meals every day is boring. I\u2019m not a DoorDash/uber eats user, so I am not replacing that cost. If you are, this definitely will save you money. I was looking for healthier, better tasting, more various and relatively affordable options for lunch. Maybe a dinner here and there. I tried these companies starting 1/2025.\n\nI\u2019ve had 24 CookUnity meals and 16 factor meals. I have eaten them fresh as well as from frozen. I\u2019ve tried their premium meals (overall not worth the up charge with either company in my opinion). I\u2019ve cooked them in a microwave, air fryer and oven. Eaten them for lunch and dinner (eating truffled fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken from CookUnity for dinner as I type this out), and just got my first breakfast meal options in my most recent order. \n\nI stick with Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Salmon for proteins. \n\nAll in all, CookUnity is a far better experience. \n\nFactor is not terrible and can be better than or atleast a nice change of pace from grocery store frozen or premade meals. So, definitely place an order, get those discount and some free goodies that only factor offers (little juice shots)\n\nWhat I Like about CookUnity:\nQuality- The quality of food is just better with CookUnity. It\u2019s fresher, better texture, and seems like a meal someone would make at home or\u2026even a restaurant. Factor meals seemed less fresh or maybe poorly sourced, the flavor was all from toppings not marinating, and just basic.\n\nVariety: CookUnity has so many different ingredients they use in various dishes. Their chefs take flavors from all over the world and pair them with sides or veggies that fit the theme. Factor just has like \u201cHey! here\u2019s this protein and this side that we have in the inventory that probably go together\u201d\n\nVeggies/Sides/ Variety (continued): The sides really made a difference. CookUnity has Chopped or whole veggies like broccoli, leafy greens, red onions, asparagus, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower\u2026 they have sides like mashed potatoes, red potatoes, Mac n cheese, noodles, and toppings/ sauces in little containers. If you are looking for healthy, you can avoid this stuff, but I freaking love me some sour cream or a side of Mac n cheese. Factor had pretty much the same game plan every time ; Cauliflower rice as a base for their protein and a side of easily microwaveable veggies like broccoli or green beans. And instead of little sauces or toppings, most meals came with a little \u201cbutter scoop\u201d(like those ones at restaurants that sorta look like ice cream\u2026 yes\u2026 I did that once also) of a topping that would melt and disperse over the food as it heated. It usually just soaks into the cauliflower rice making it more mushy.\n\nCooking/ Packaging: they both come in single serving containers, but that\u2019s what we are here for. CookUnity containers are compostable material, while Factor comes in plastic. This means it less environmentally friendly, less healthy after heating (plastics), and more limited. CookUnity meals can be made in the ways I mentioned in my 1st paragraph (don\u2019t put the CookUnity container in a AirFryer unless you have good insurance!), while Factor, due to the sloppy base of cauliflower rice, can really only be heated in the microwave. CookUnity even gives directions for oven and microwave. CookUnity is delivered in a reusable bag that the delivery person with pick up when delivering your next order. Factor is a big box with a cooling pad and insulation lining.\n\nAdvice:\nBe adventurous!: A huge value here is adding variety and eating meals you might never make yourself, so take advantage of that!\n\nThat said, have some guidelines. Stick to proteins you know you will like or look for atleast one ingredient you know you know you will like even if the rest of the dish is a mystery. With factor, always choose whole proteins. Their diced or sliced proteins always tend be mushy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the meal, call the company and tell them!!! They will credit you the cost of the meal almost every time. Both companies have pretty friendly customer service teams.\n\nTake Advantage of your discounts!: Order as many meals as makes sense based on pricing, especially for CookUnity. Maybe not factor, but that\u2019s my biased, which is everything so far anyways. After so many meals in an order, they start to go up in price due to shipping and the company not wanting to get totally burned. I\u2019ve found that 14-18 meals gives you the best price point. Sure, from frozen is never better than from fresh, but if you are already eating frozen meals, that\u2019s a non-factor.\n\nPause your order: unless you plan to eat all those meals in a week, you will want to pause your order. If not, they will send you another shipment next week, with or without you selecting meals.\n\nYes, pause your order before canceling. Especially if you are brand hopping. Most of the companies will offer you more discounts when you try to cancel. If you are brand hopping, use their initial discounts while pause the companies you\u2019ve already used. Once you\u2019ve cycled through all the companies you want to try, go back and cancel the 1st one you went to, take the discount and stock up again! You can make these discounts last a really long time if you do this.\n\nBe sorta thoughtful about which meals might freeze better than others. When I get my order, I immediately freeze a large portion and keep a few in my fridge for the upcoming week. Example, I don\u2019t think leafy greens freeze well, so I eat those 1st. I think they will all freeze and reheat fine, but, maybe give it some consideration.\n\nI am not paid by CookUnity on anything, just really happy I found them. But hey, if someone at CookUnity sees this, I\u2019m totally down to write more reviews in exchange for discounts! Comment below!\n\nI have not tried any of the others: Tempo by homechef, hello fresh\u2019s or blue apron\u2019s new line or the few others out there. I also have not tried the packaged meals from HelloFresh or Blue Apron. I think I might give HelloFresh and Blue Apron a try in the future once I\u2019m done getting all I can out of these companies. They have been around awhile and I have heard decent things about them or been recommended by friend to try their packaged meals. If anyone wants to build some callouses on their fingers and give me a run down on those groups, please do.\n\nMaybe, I\u2019ll come back with more info and edit or comment later, but that\u2019s all I can think of for now. \n\nThanks for coming to my T.E.D talk.",

I wanted to take care of lunches and dinners as I work long hours in a trade and am in the gym 3 to 5 times per week.  I\u2019d say overall a decent experience for my first box. With discounts applied on the total came out to about about $95 for all 14 meals. Decent price per meal I\u2019d say. I\u2019d spend more than that a week on groceries and eating out, personally. \n\nNow, I chose all the protein plus meal options.  I\u2019d say flavor wise, the meals are decent. Definitely not bad as all. Some I really enjoyed. Let\u2019s take a look at the meals from this box and their macros. \n\nThis box contained, meal wise:\n\nCreamy Tomato Pork Tenderloin: 670kcal 49F 18C 42p\n\nTomato and Beef Walnut Ragu: 610kcal\n47G 18C 31P\n\nGround Pork Cheddar and Chili Mac: 570kcal\n30F 47C 31P\n\nSmokey Bbq Chicken Breast: 640kcal\n31F 48C 42P\n\nSanta Fe - Style Green Chili beef skillet 690kcal\n41F 51C 32P\n\nBefore ordering I didn\u2019t realize how fat heavy, and carb lite these meals were. It makes sense now why I didn\u2019t feel like the portions were big enough most of the time. being that they were filled with a ton of fat it makes sense why it was decently palatable. I also had a protein bar with most of my lunches, which helped with satiety.  Though most of the time I was still hungry. \n\nI aimed for 2200- 2400 kcal per day between the meals, snacks, and breakfast . For reference I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and started the week at 165lb. I dropped down to 161lb  this morning. \n\nI\u2019d have to guess the lack of carbs is where most of the weight went. I was in a deficit before this for a few weeks and losing weight, so the rapid loss was unexpected. Beforehand I was losing about 1lb / week on a similar amount of calories . \n\nMy energy seems fine over this week, maybe even better than usual as I\u2019m getting more veggies and micros in factor meals than usual. \nOverall I\u2019d give the experience 6.5 -7 / 10.  Have any of you tried Factor? What were your meals like?\n\n\n",

It wouldn't work.  I used the chat in the app.  The bot or person, canceled my plan and said I needed to try sign up again for a code to be applied.  It worked but now delivery was 2 weeks out, just an hour after I had signed up the first time.  \n\nThis being the second issue I used the chat again and they got me food to be delivered this week... or so I thought.\n\nYesterday nothing arrived,  ok maybe tomorrow...I happens.  Today, the app shows delivered.  I called customer service this time.  I asked when I could expect my delivery.... \"it was delivered yesterday\".  I stated it wasn't and was immediately put on hold. 5 to 8 minutes later I was told it would be refunded or credit applied going forward. I asked for a refund.  So far only a partial refund.  \n\nIf I do not get my meals next week's I am going to cancel.  This service could be too good to be true.",

      "title": "Factor vegan meals review",
      "text": "Got my Factor box Today and already had 2 of their meals. Below is full review.\n\nChoice:\n\nFactor has some vegan meals to chose from but since its not a completely vegan service, you may have to repeat few meals. I dont find this an issue because I often repeat my favorite meal even using other meal services.\n\nDelivery:\n\n5/5 Delivery was right on time and it was some new company I never heard of. Delivery lady waited to handover the box to me instead of just dropping it outside which I liked. I did tip them on their website for exceptional service. Rarely anybody calls us and waits for us to come out to pick up our packages in this area.\n\nPackaging:\n\n5/5 Packaging was amazing, they had a huge ice pack on top then 4 meals then another ice pack in the mid then 6 more meals and then another ice pack at bottom. All 3 ice packs came frozen all the way from Illinois to NYC. Very impressed by packaging technique they used. Each meal was in contact with ice packs except 2 in the middle which were also getting nice cooling from above and below. Meals were well preserved, not a single meal leaking/ bloated.\n\nMeals:\n\n5/5 Unlike other vegan meal kits, Factor meals are divided in 3 sections. Main dish, side and some topping. Now this may not be true for all meals but the containers I have got all have 3 partitions. I am highly impressed by this because I dont want sauce mixed in. Sometimes it can make meal watery. Here i also have option to mix how much sauce I want.\n\nTaste:\n\n5/5 My first meal was 3 bean chili with small corn side dish and some sauce. At first I thought it will be bland and boring. I have started meal kits now and I am very happy with them. I never thought I will return to prepared meals ever. BUT...This meal was amazing. Taste was so good without sauce and after adding sauce I was blown away. I cleaned entire tray. Side was some corn dish. It was minimalistic but very nice sweet and sour flavor. I cleaned entire tray. But 580 calories were not enough for me so I decided to taste a second meal. This one was some peanut buddha bowl with peanut sauce and broccoli. This meal was even better than earlier one. Peanut flavor was great and it had some veggies and quinoa base. Broccoli was steamed and just ok. I was so impressed than I was going to try a third meal. But then I had a protein shake and was full so I left it for later.\n\nOverall:\n\n5/5 After I got disappointed by other prepared meal services, I disabled Factor as well and switched to meal kits. But I am going to activate Factor again and order every few weeks. I am highly impressed by this meal service. I just hope they remain consistent.\n\n\n\nUpdate: Cancelled due to limited variety of meals.",

I imagine because of different goals. I want an implementation that's simple enough to own. Something I can drop into a C++ project wherever I need more leverage, and customize and tweak as much as I feel like.\n\nI've tried to provide a decent walk through in the README, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Please note that it's very much a work in progress, with unexpected feature gaps all over the place, but what's already there works well enough to play around with and should give a general idea.\n\nAnd that's about all I have to say at this point...\n\nhttps://github.com/codr7/forthy2",

      "text": "I'm trying to learn factor, and this is my third attempt, this time by doing Project Euler. I want to solve [problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) using a Fibonacci function, and besides solving it in a naive and ineffective way, I came up with the following two, that should be quite effective, but don't like either of them because of being completely unreadable:\n\n    { 1 2 }\n      [ 4000000 &lt; ]\n      [ [ last2 ] keep -rot + [ suffix ] keep ] do while 1 head*\n      [ even? ] filter sum .\n\n    { 1 } 2\n      [ dup 4000000 &lt; ]\n      [ [ dup last ] dip [ + ] keep swap [ suffix ] dip ] while\n      drop\n      [ even? ] filter sum .\n\nAnother downside that further reduces readability is that the Fibonacci sequence calculation is too integrated with the conditional check that is supposed to end the calculation, and that it is littering the stack with temporary values that have to be discarded afterward.\n\nSo I've decided to check how similar tasks are solved in the standard library, and came across `lprimes`, which outputs a sequence of prime numbers, in a lazy way, e.g. it's produced as it is consumed, and you pipe its output to `lwhile` with a `[ 4000000 &lt; ]` condition, and then convert it to a regular array for further filtering and summation.\n\nSo this is someting I came up with:\n\n    { 1 2 } ! Initial data for the sequence\n      [ dup last2 + suffix ] ! take the last two values, sum and push back\n      lfrom-by ! in a lazy manner\n      5 swap ltake ! debug: take first five\n      list&gt;array . ! convert to an array and print\n\nThe output is, however, very surprising to me:\n\n    { { 1 2 } { 1 2 3 } { 1 2 3 5 } { 1 2 3 5 8 } { 1 2 3 5 8 13 } }\n\nIt's returning five arrays, and it turns out it keeps all the interim results in the previous sequence items.\n\nIs there a better way to only keep one array, or be able to address last two elements of the sequence to build the next one?\n\nBonus question: documentation says that `lfrom-by` is taking an integer and a quotation, and returns a lazy list of integers. Why integers? Why can't arbitrary values be used?\n\nThe solution I have so far:\n\n    { 1 2 } ! Initial data for the sequence\n      [ dup last2 + suffix ] ! take the last two values, sum and push back\n      lfrom-by ! in a lazy manner\n      [ last 4000000 &lt; ] lwhile\n      list&gt;array last\n      [ even? ] filter\n      sum .\n\nIs there a better way of building lazy sequences? I could only find very basic examples (e.g. `odds` in `list.lazy.examples`), nothing that would be able to use two last values.",

The word for chicken, g\u0101i in Cantonese and j\u012b in Mandarin, sounds like several words of good fortune.\n\nJust to name a few phrases that my parents shared with us:\n\n* h\u00f3u sai gaai \u597d\u4e16\u754c - A Cantonese phrase that roughly translates to good world, good life.\n* d\u00e0j\u00edd\u00e0l\u00ec \u5927\u5409\u5927\u5229 - A Mandarin phrase that roughly translates to great luck, great profit.\n* y\u00e1uh t\u00e0uh y\u00e1uh m\u00e9ih \u6709\u5934\u6709\u5c3e - A Cantonese phrase that literally translates to: \"has a head, has a tail.\" It means \"good beginning, good ending.\" This is one of the reasons why it's important to make a whole chicken for Lunar New Year.\n* j\u00e1au p\u00e0h j\u00e1au w\u00e0h \u6293\u6252\u6293\u93f5 - A Toisanese phrase, related to eating the chicken legs, that roughly means \"face all challenges with persistence.\"\n\nSo, basically, eat a whole chicken if you want to live. (jk)\n\n## Using a Proper Knife\n\nThe most intricate part of this recipe is the last step, where we carve up the chicken into pieces we can easily grab with a chopstick.\n\nMy dad has two knives - a \"chef's knife\", meant for vegetables and boneless meats, and a heavy duty cleaver, meant for occasions like this.\n\nIt's a lot harder to do this without a proper cleaver, so here are a few options you can look up:\n\n* Dexter Russell Heavy Duty Cleaver\n* [The same brand (not same model) as my dad's 40 year-old cleaver](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ut_sk=1.XR79XxYXt6sDAC8yCxOJl3U5_21380790_1609898344895.Copy.1&amp;id=630231282048&amp;detailSharePosition=interactBar&amp;sourceType=item&amp;suid=6C603E4D-6164-4DA8-8C61-790B2DE81EE4&amp;shareUniqueId=6881406817&amp;un=5fbdcd42b3253757dfb454b3d994b7d3&amp;share_crt_v=1&amp;spm=a2159r.13376460.0.0&amp;sp_tk=dThBVGNzQld2OWY=&amp;cpp=1&amp;shareurl=true&amp;short_name=h.4S1KiFP&amp;bxsign=scdfCTl7pW2s3tCpp7nnG1tdxUFrtYdbbyIT60TmslnzN4-9ZCBvFh4ynYYvYfyQWF2AOvFNA2Xinbs5tp8w4mgHthhB2LS4_4Gbo7_S0r1O7U&amp;sm=ddd6d0&amp;app=chrome) (ships from China)\n\nIf you don't have one, you can also try cutting at the various joints, which my dad didn't demonstrate but said is possible.\n\nYou'll also want a thick wooden cutting board which helps absorb the impact of forceful chopping.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Chinese knives, check out my [previous post on the basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/kr7bsq/basic_chinese_knife_skills_101_%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%88%80%E6%8A%80%E5%B7%A7_i_sat_down/).\n\n## Choosing a Chicken\n\nIf you're making this for Lunar New Year and following Chinese tradition, you'll need to buy a chicken that has its head, feet, toes, etc. intact.\n\nThe two main types that my dad uses are \"Yellow Hair Chicken\" and \"Kwai Fei Chicken\".\n\n* Yellow Hair Chicken tends to have more chewy meat. Many Chinese people prefer this.\n* Kwai Fei Chicken tends to have a larger quantity of meat on it, with thicker meat that's more tender.\n\nFor this specific recipe, my dad got hooked up by his old restaurant with their wholesale pricing, but you can usually buy these at an Asian grocery store or market.\n\nIf you don't have access to an Asian grocery store, you can just buy as fresh and whole of a chicken as you can get, and try to stick to a chicken that's around 4 pounds so it cooks more evenly in the pot.\n\nThe fresher the chicken, the better. And, if you can, buy it sustainably.\n\n## Sourcing Chicken Sustainably\n\nThe most environmentally friendly (and freshest) way to source chicken is to raise your own, just like my parents did back in the day.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s not easy for most of us, so some options would be to shop with a local farm or butcher, or to buy Animal Welfare Certified chicken.\n\nAmongst the strongest seals of approvals is the **Animal Welfare Certified** label from the Global Animal Partnership, a non profit originally created by Whole Foods Market in 2008.\n\nThis is one of only 3 food certification labels endorsed by the ASPCA, one of the oldest and largest humane societies in the world, the others being \u201c**Certified Humane**\u201d and \u201c**Animal Welfare Approved**.\u201d Although they\u2019re not as widespread, they set much higher standards than the more common USDA Organic certifications.\n\nIf you live in the US and feel inclined to support these causes, you can look for GAP certified meat at Whole Foods, or through Butcher Box, a popular meat delivery subscription service that sources their meats in line with all of the highest standards that we\u2019ve touched on.\n\n## The Recipe\n\nMain Ingredients\n\n* 4 lb **whole chicken** (traditionally for Lunar New Year, the chicken has its head &amp; feet intact)\n* 2 oz **green onion**\n* 1.5 oz **ginger**\n* 5 tbsp **corn oil**\n\nAdditional Flavor &amp; Seasoning\n\n* 1 tsp **salt** (for boiling water)\n* 2 tsp **salt** (for ginger scallion sauce)\n* 1 tbsp **sesame oil**\n\n# Step 1 - Boil water, add salt\n\nSet the stove to high heat and start boiling a generous amount of water in the pot you'll be using.\n\nWe'll want to be able to fully submerge our chicken in the water to make sure it cooks evenly.\n\nWe'll also be adding **1 teaspoon of salt**. My dad says not to add too much here.\n\n# Step 2 - Prepare &amp; cook chicken\n\nWait for the water to come to a boil.\n\nWe'll be doing a couple of things in this step, mostly to ensure that the entire chicken is cooked evenly for maximum tenderness.\n\n* **Pierce a hole in the skin in the neck -** This helps the water flow through the chicken cavity to help it cook more evenly.\n* **Stretch the legs away from the body several times -** This helps to avoid having a big clump of chicken meat that's undercooked.\n* **Slowly dip the chicken 3 times in the boiling water -** This helps even out the temperatures on the inside of the cavity and on the exterior of the chicken. Make sure the water is already boiling before you do this.\n* **Add the chicken and make sure it's completely submerged -** If you have to add more boiling water, do it.\n\nFrom here, we'll cover the pot.\n\nHere's a rough heat / timing overview:\n\n* Once the pot's been covered, leave it on high heat for 5 minutes as the water comes to a boil again.\n* Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for another 35-40 minutes. The larger the chicken, the longer you cook it. The sweet spot is 4 pounds.\n* Check if it's done. If so, transfer it to an ice bath. (More on both of these later.)\n\n# Step 3 - Mince scallions and ginger\n\nWhile we wait for the chicken to cook, we'll start on our sauce by mincing our **green onions** (2 oz) and **ginger** (1.5 oz)\u200b.\n\nMy dad said the exact ratio and amounts don't matter too much. Most recipes I've seen use more scallions than ginger.\n\nHaving a surplus of sauce is a great problem to have, since you can use it on pretty much everything. (I LOVE dousing my rice and vegetables in this addictive sauce)\n\nFor the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.\n\nFor the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.\n\nMy dad is using separate plates to hold the green onions and ginger. The ginger will be cooked first in the next step, so this makes it easier to separate.\n\nAlso, feel free to use a food processor here instead of mincing.\n\n# Step 4 - Heat oil, cook ginger scallions\n\nWe'll heat up our wok on high heat and add **corn oil** (5 tbsp).\n\nThe oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.\n\nA good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts \"shimmering\", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.\n\nWhy do we do this? By cooking everything in oil, we unlock the aromatics of the ginger and green onion.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.\n\n# Step 5 - Flavor the sauce\n\nWe'll add **salt** (2 tsp) and **sesame oil** (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.\n\nDo a taste test and adjust if necessary. My dad emphasized multiple times how important it is to add sesame oil here, so make sure you don't skip it.\n\n# Step 6 - Prepare an ice bath\n\nGrab a big bowl and dump a few handfuls of ice into it. Fill it roughly halfway with cold water.\n\nThe ice bath is very important - once the chicken is done cooking, we need to immediately cool it down.\n\nWhy is this so important?\n\n* **It helps the meat contract and locks the juices inside - I**f we skip this step, juices will flood out as we chop the chicken into pieces.\n* **It helps the skin stay attached -** Without this step, we'll have a bunch of loose pieces of skin everywhere.\n* **It gives the skin a bit more of a chewy texture**\n\n# Step 7 - Determine if the chicken is done\n\nOnce the time draws near, we can uncover the pot. Poke the thickest part of the chicken (around the thigh) deeply with a chopstick.\n\nIf blood or red fluid leaks out, we need to cook it for a few more minutes.\n\nIf the fluid is clear, it's ready for the ice bath.\n\nFeel free to use your newfound chicken broth however you'd like. In the video, my dad created two additional dishes (a soup and a veggie) out of it by boiling bok choy with some ginger.\n\n# Step 8 - Lift and transfer to ice bath\n\nCarefully take two chopsticks under the chicken wings, and lift it over the pot.\n\nSuspend it over the pot for 30-45 seconds to let some of the residual water drip out.\n\nThen, carefully transfer it into the ice bath. Prepare for a splash!\n\nLet the chicken sit in the bath for 5 minutes, occasionally pouring water over the surface of the chicken and rotating the chicken in the container.\n\n# Step 9 - Carve the chicken\n\nThis could honestly be its own post, but for now it will live in a very detailed step in this recipe.\n\nThis is a lot easier to follow in our video, where we dedicate about 6 minutes of time to this segment.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind before you start.\n\n* My dad\u2019s done this hundreds of times, and it took him about 10 minutes from start to finish. It\u2019ll probably take a lot longer if you\u2019re a beginner like me, but the main thing is just to make sure your cleaver is sharp and that you\u2019re moving carefully and deliberately.\u00a0\n* If you don\u2019t already have a cleaver, it\u2019s still technically possible, but I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making this dish.\n* For easier, safer cutting, you should use a larger, thicker cutting board that\u2019s preferably made of wood, and you should place a moist towel underneath it to increase its stability.\n\nHow to plate, according to Chinese tradition:\n\n* Basically everything is plated - even parts that aren't readily edible like the head.\n* Each piece of chicken is laid out on a large plate according to where it was on its body, head to toe, right to left.\n* You'll often see this served on a large oval-shaped plate.\n\nOrder of operations:\n\n* Cut off the neck and feet, cut into small pieces\n* Cut and place the head and butt at opposite ends of the middle axis of the plate\n* Remove the wings and thighs\n* Cut and split the torso into two halves (front and back)\n* Split the back in half, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut and pry away the breast bone, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut the thighs and wings into small pieces\n\nCutting techniques:\n\n* A technique my dad uses a lot involves making a shallow slice to wedge the cleaver, and then hitting down on the blade with our palm to drive the blade through the bone.\u00a0\n* In our recent knife skills interview, my dad talked about the 3 different parts of the blade - the root, the belly, and the tip. When chopping through bone, he always makes contact with the root, or the part of the blade closest to the handle.\u00a0\n\nWhen I first started this project, documenting how my dad carves a chicken was high on the list of traditions I wanted to learn and share. It always feels like I\u2019m watching an artist at work when I see my dad gracefully chop and plate everything.\u00a0\n\nEvery cut has an intention, and every piece has a place. Almost everything goes on the plate, and nothing is wasted. Especially for Lunar New Year and other celebrations, bak chit gai is meant to be one of the main decorative centerpieces on the dinner table, and carving it up into beautiful bite-sized pieces is an honor that I hope to take on one day for my own family.\u00a0\n\n# Our why\n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipes :)",

      "text": "I have not cooked with Jowl before. But to save money thought it might be an easy addition to my stew. I wish I had used fat from it instead of my beef cut for the veggies I learned in the end. I also ended up pouring out the majority of the fat from the jowl.\nMy concern is really in the toughness of the jowl. I\u2019m hoping that it will soften during the long stewing process. But after I\u2019d cooked the jowl I noticed the meat had a very tough chewiness to it I\u2019m not sure my wife will find appetizing. \nCan anyone confirm if the jowl meat will soften over the stewing process??\n\nHere is my basic process and recipe:\nDutch oven stew!\n1 lb beef roast (cut fat away for veggies)\n2-3 pieces of celery\nHalf a large onion\n1 poblano pepper\n1 red pepper\nButcher box of jowl (1.5lb roughly)\nFistful of carrots\nLarge Portabello mush\n1 box veggie stock (usually use beef was out)\n4 cups water \nCouple tablespoons of better than beef bouillon \nFlour\nHalf small can of fire roasted tomatoes\nHalf cup red wine (cab in our case)\n\nI begin by taking the cut fat from beef and cook it down in the Dutch oven on stove. Then add all cut up veggies plus a tiny bit of the beef bouillon. \nRemove cooked veggies put in bowl. \nThen I had the beef cuts tossed in flour and seasoning to pot and gave them a quick searing leaving them still rather uncooked. Removed the beef and added to bowl of veggies. Then I added in my jowl meat and let that cook down for close to 25 min on medium heat.  Possibly longer can\u2019t really recall. This is where I realized this would have been a better starting point for fat content. So instead I strained the grease and removed the jowl bits adding to the big bowl of stew contents. I then take half a cup of red wine and half the veggies stock to deglaze the Dutch oven and get all those tasty tidbits. Then added remaining big veggie stock carton plus the 4 cups of water and bouillon, then all my meats and veggies. And half a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Now I taste some of the jowl at this point and realized hmmmm that is very chewy. Hopefully it\u2019ll come out in the long cook. \n\nI always change up the recipe when I make stew. Usually it\u2019s bacon not jowl. And I experiment with more of a tomato base sometimes by adding tomato paste to it. But my wife prefers a more beef gravy like base. This time I\u2019m experimenting with the veggie stock. We shall see. \n\nSo please any suggestions on the jowl prep is greatly appreciate or any suggestions comments overall. \n\nSorry for grammar.

Yesterday, I shopped with gf and insist we should buy the boneless breast meat, so I did the math.\n\n**Boneless Chicken Breasts**\n\n* **Price**: 8 EUR per kg\n* **Meat Yield**: Boneless chicken breasts provide a direct 100% meat yield since there are no bones.\n\n**Bone-In Chicken Thighs**\n\n* **Price**: 3.2 EUR per kg\n* **Meat Yield**: Bone-in chicken thighs generally yield about 65% meat after removing bones and skin. This means that from 1 kg of bone-in chicken thighs, we get approximately 650 grams of meat\u200b ([Just Cook](https://justcook.butcherbox.com/bone-in-vs-boneless-chicken-when-and-how-to-prepare-it/))\u200b\u200b ([BBQ Host](https://bbqhost.com/bone-in-vs-boneless-chicken-weight/))\u200b.\n* To get 1 kg of meat from bone-in thighs, we need approximately 1.54 kg of bone-in thighs (1 kg / 0.65).  approximately 4.93 EUR (1.54 kg \\* 3.2 EUR/kg\n\n**Conclusion** : For 1 kg meat, Boneless Chicken Breasts (8 EUR) vs Bone-In Chicken Thighs (4.93 EUR)!!  \nBeing frugal, I tell gf my calculation, discuss in details and eventually we buy the Boneless Chicken Breasts. I give up.",

      "text": "So I just turned 22, and a month ago i bought a new car. I\u2019m paying $406 a month plus $205 a month in insurance. I also pay for butcher box (22 meals worth) for $169 every 8 weeks. I pay for ps+ and the disney+ bundle which is like $18 total for both. After all that, i can save $500 minimum a month. I make $18 an hour and might do doordash again for an extra $145 a week estimated. I keep running numbers about how much rent i can afford, and the 30% rule just seems off. Idk if I\u2019m doing it wrong or what. I wanna move out, but only if i can afford it and not live paycheck to paycheck. I don\u2019t mean living frugally, i mean i don\u2019t want to have to not eat at all to save money for rent\n\nEdit due to some misunderstanding due to me being terrible at writing. I know at this exact moment I\u2019m far off. Ig the question i really meant to ask is is $18/hr enough to live comfortably on $1000 a month rent? I truly appreciate the advice. I understand the concern about my car, but while living at home, i can pay more towards principle, thus pay it off early. The plan is to pay it off in 1-1.5 years early. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m not gonna be stuck at 18/hr, i was just curious how doable it would be if that did happen. I hope this makes it more clear. Sorry for the confusion",

But it isn't worth the hassle if they are going to trick people into ordering an extra box with a promo and then remove the promo without making good on their promise.

Unfortunately Butcher Box is not listed as a grocer/supermarket and instead is listed as a US Small Shop. \nI am now contemplating whether these large purchases with BB are worth it when I could be getting so many points at the grocery store. \nI emailed them to ask if they can change their business classification, which I understand is an unrealistic request but perhaps if many of us banded together they would look into changing it.

      "text": "Hi there! I recently had a billing issue with Butcherbox and I wanted to get other's opinions. \n\n  \nI had a box set to bill on June 30th. I had skipped the past few months and didn't realize that my card on file was expired. When they tried to bill on the 30th of June it did not go through due to this expired card. I did get a few emails about it but I had some life stuff going on so I will admit I did not attend to it right away knowing I had 30 days. On July 29th I logged in to update my billing information to ensure my account was canceled. I even got a final notice email that said \"please do this before July 30th to ensure your account does not get canceled\". Yes... it was last minute but still within the given timeframe.\n\nThey sent me an email to a secure link to update my payment information and I put in the information. As far as I'm aware I'm all good at this point right? It's 8am on July 29th. Wrong. I received an email the next day saying my account was canceled. No big, I can reactivate it... BUT now I've lost my \"for life\" items of ground beef (free with sign up) and bacon (which I paid for!!). \n\n  \nI reached out to customer service to try to get this resolved. They are saying well it was canceled cause it wasn't billed for 30 days. I explained to them that I fixed it before July 30th (that even their email said was the time frame) and I did everything I was supposed to do on my end. Today they got back to me again and said \"well even though you updated your payment the system didn't try to bill you after so your box got canceled.\" I just don't understand how the system not billing me is my fault- it seems like its on the fault of their system.\n\n  \nNeedless to say I am insanely frustrated. I've been a customer for four years and don't feel like this was my fault and I can't believe how unwilling Butcherbox is as a company to help me resolve this issue. Do I seem like i'm in the wrong here? I like the company and the quality of the meats but at this point I don't feel like they care about their customers.",

HC provides several simpler meal options, give you an idea of a meal's shelf life in order to assist prioritizing which meals to make first, provide single-use baking trays, but use a lot more plastic in packaging.\n\n**Factor\\_** \\- (apparently also owned by HF) tried them for one week. Was not impressed. For the same price as a 3-meal 2-serving shipment, you get three single-serving microwave meals. High quality, sure, and requiring minimal if no prep, but how much would you pay for a microwave meal?\n\n**Marley Spoon** \\- I'm in a trial period, and... so far, I'm a fan! (disclaimer: not an employee nor a paid sponsor) Would never stay on and pay full price, but whenever I get another offer, I'll give them another shot. I like their packaging. They have a cardboard tray with all the meals' ingredients (except the meats) plus a single ice pack, cutting down on packaging. They offer three tiers of meals, a standard selection and premium selection, but also offer a more basic selection at a reduced price, which is different. The meal portions are larger. Even when the meats are still usually 10oz portions, the other ingredients flesh it out more. One meal is two hearty servings, where with HC and HF it felt like either too much if I ate it all or not enough if I divided it into two meals. Only quibble is that both times I've had delivery issues.\n\nWhat other meal services have you used and what has been your reaction?",

We\u2019ve weathered the price increases, sometimes having to opt out all together and pull stuff together from the pantry, but we try budget in a meal service 90% of the time. Recently it\u2019s been hard to feed my partner and myself with some of the portions. Almost every meal with enough protein is an extra $8 or $10 dollars per serving. I was charged and extra $5 for a meal because it was a \u201cHall of Fame\u201d choice with nothing special about it at all (no extra protein, truffle oil, etc). I understand they are trying to keep from raising prices across the board, but some of it is ridiculous. The only positive is it\u2019s led us to more vegetarian dishes and kept us from buying the breads and lunch extras, but twice this week with Home Chef meals I\u2019ve had to serve all of it to my partner to make it a reasonable portion and I\u2019ve brushed it off to him with \u201cI had a huge lunch\u201d so he wouldn\u2019t feel bad and then ate a piece of fruit before bed. While I appreciate the help getting my beach body back, I\u2019m not happy. I\u2019ll buy extra risotto and pasta at the store to stretch them in the future but honestly, 6oz of protein and 5oz of pasta with some vegetables is not enough food for two people who are not watching their calories. Am I the only person frustrated with this?

As such, I am looking for a meal kit that does not use OnTrac in my area. I am in eastern Washington state if that helps.\n\nI used to be an EveryPlate customer but I canceled after 3 deliveries due to leaky packaging and super repetitive meals. I was a Hello Fresh customer about 5 years ago and canceled that for the same reason.\n\nAny suggestions? Price is not an issue but would strongly prefer traditional meal kits instead of oven/microwave meals. This will be for 2 people.",

I received a second box (I didn\u2019t cancel in time) and none of the receipts were included.

What meal kits would everyone recommend we try next? Right now, we are trying out the different companies to see which one we like best, so we can stick with one company for weekly meals.  Also, does anyone know of meal kits that offer good Chinese meals in their weekly rotation? Thank you to everyone in advance!",

We tried Home Chef for a few months and weren\u2019t impressed. The meals were all kinda basic and bland. Quesadillas, cheeseburgers, flatbread, chicken or fish with a vegetable side, etc. That\u2019s all stuff I can easily make without a meal service. \n\nI love to cook, I just feel like I make the same meals over and over again and would like a meal service that can introduce us to new recipes. I don\u2019t want food that comes in an oven-ready dish or microwave meals. We like lots of vegetables and I\u2019m interested in Mediterranean style foods. I am a little turned off from delivery meat after some of the meat HC sent so I wouldn\u2019t even mind a service with mostly vegetarian options and then we can add our own meat from the local butcher. \n\nAny ideas? I\u2019ve been thinking about Hungry Root but I can\u2019t see their meals without signing up, and some of their ads make it look like you just get a box of snacks. Any input is appreciated! ",

      "title": "Factor to Home Chef? Some questions",
      "text": "Hi all!\n\nBackground: I live solo and have been using Factor for the past couple years. While I do find the service very useful and the meals generally pretty good, I did observe that it kind of made me dependent on them. I found that since I didn't _need_ to go to the store I would often just eat the Factor meals when I had them or otherwise just get fast food. I'd like to get myself to do actual cooking / use my oven more, and I'm hoping that being more comfortable with the cooking process and ingredients will make me less dependent on mealkit services. However, I want to ease into it so I don't just impulsively go back to *all* fast food.\n\nI had previously tried Home Chef once but struggled with the cooking part (despite it being simple, I am so green in the kitchen that it wasn't so easy). It didn't help that I'm a bit of a picky eater, and also that everything Home Chef offered was for two servings so I had to deal with leftovers. None of these were really major issues, but at the time I decided Factor would be a better fit.\n\nThat said I looked at Home Chef again recently and noticed that they have added a lot more option types to their menus, including sheet pan meals and also \"heat and eat\" meals like Factor. And overall I am thinking of making some life changes including giving cooking a more honest effort.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\nAm I able to combine all three meal types in a single box (standard, sheet pan, and heat/eat)? Further can I adjust box sizes on the fly as needed? These would be a huge advantage over Factor for what I'm looking for, so I could week by week decide what proportion of meals to have be ready to eat vs making myself (and not have to maintain two subscriptions like Factor + HelloFresh).\n\nHow does the cost structure compare to Factor? I tried to find pricing info on their site but it seems like you might have to get a ways into the setup process first. _Edit to add: I did find some cost info on their website after all, that said it doesn't go into a ton of detail on the different types / box sizes, so any insight from experience is appreciated!_\n\nWhat does order timing look like? With Factor you have to make selections by Wednesday night every week and if you miss it they'll just send you random stuff. They also delivered all meals on Tuesdays (though I later found that you could change the delivery date for like Sun-Wed I think). Is Home Chef similar? Which day is their order cutoff day for each week? (I assume delivery dates vary by area)\n\nWhere does Tempo fit into the mix? It seems like a separate service by the same company that is more of a direct competitor to Factor. Has this had an impact so far on Heat/Eat meals being available through Home Chef itself?\n\nThanks for any info you can provide! Also any other feedback on Home Chef is appreciated.",

After six weeks of getting kits from them I can say\n- the selection is terrible, especially for pescatarians \n- the recipes are just not nice - bland/weird ingredient combos\n- they have already left things out of my box\n- the ingredients go off quicker than the \u201cuse-by\u201d estimate \n- the levels of plastic waste are awful. Everything is packed in plastic, including thick plastic bottles that are difficult to even get sauce out of.\n\nWhy is Home Chef even still in business? We have tried Green Chef, which was good but expensive and Marley Spoon, which was also poor choice-wise for pescatarians but the ingredients were fine.\n\nI do wish Hello Fresh would include better quality ingredients sometimes. But honestly their recipes and choice are outstanding, they keep down plastic waste, and they are very reliable. ",

I\u2019ve done different meal kits in the past such as home chef, factor, and blue apron.\n\nTo start off, i\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t really look at calories and things like that. I just picked things that sounded good. Upon really looking at everything it all seems so high in calories which still doesn\u2019t bother me except today I opened the Lemon Caper Chicken with Fettuccine and parmesan cheese. I\u2019m just shocked that this is 990 cal for the amount that it is it just doesn\u2019t seem calculated correctly especially because I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot of sauce on this to cover the noodles.\n\nThe reason I was kind of drawn in to cook unity was because there were so many options. Which is one of the reasons I stopped using Factor was it felt like the same meals every week. However, I\u2019m more than halfway through the meals that I ordered and they all just seem so bland. \nI\u2019m just wondering if maybe the quality has gone down or what other peoples opinions are I also got the free cookies for life when I signed up however, my cookie was smashed a bits from the packaging which also was not great. They said it would be delivered between 12 and eight on Sunday and I don\u2019t think it would have been cold and fresh had I not been home majority of the ice was kind of melted already. \n\nI\u2019ve made sure I\u2019ve paused it, but curious to know what some people\u2019s favorites are I tried to do a variety of Mexican-American Asian dishes with a protein and a carb or protein and veggie. I\u2019m a pretty open eater.. ",

      "text": "A few weeks ago, I signed up for Home Chef. Unfortunately, my first box was a big disappointment. I had to discard about 90% of the food. The box only had one ice pack at the bottom, and it had completely melted by the time it arrived. The \"free dessert\" was packed at the top of the box and was 68\u00b0F, and all the sauces and meat were lukewarm. The only items I was able to use were a few veggies and the dry seasoning.\n\nI reached out to Home Chef, and they kindly issued a credit, so I decided to give it another try. This week, even with the temperature only reaching 45\u00b0F and being home to bring the box inside right away, I had to again throw out the dessert and two boxes of egg bites. A quick temp. check had the egg bites at 57\u00b0F. Again, there was just the one ice pack at the bottom of the box. Thankfully, the ice pack was still frozen, and the meat and sauces were safe this time.\n\nIt's a real shame because everything I was able to try was quite tasty. However, I had to cancel my subscription. If they can't guarantee safe food delivery in 45\u00b0 weather, I'm concerned about what will happen when summer arrives.\n\nDoes anyone know of a delivery service that consistently ensures food arrives at a safe temperature?",

I don't have time a few days a week to cook dinner and hate meal prepping because I like variety. So I have started getting meal kits delivered.\n\nI haven't had any issues with Tempo sending boxes out. It's unfortunate though that they can only send them 3-4 days a week and never on weekends (at least where I am) so I never ended up bringing one of my meals for lunch at work on Mondays. The meals were always cold when they arrived and had no issues with leakage or anything. Breaking down the boxes and throwing away/recycling everything is a pain though, and that's to be expected. That's moreso a heads up if you haven't gotten meal kits before.\n\nThey have a good variety of low calorie options, which I like. They were filling for me personally and had a good diverse menu when it came to veggies, proteins and carbs. I had gotten to try some new things in my diet, like farro, which is exciting. However, I do wish that the meals had even a little portion of carbs as a lot of the low calorie options didn't. The vegetables were seasoned, often with a seasoned butter and the proteins often were not bland. Everything was at the very least edible. Sometimes the chicken would take me a little longer to get through because there wouldn't be much of a flavor profile besides the chicken, though. \n\nThe meals last quite a while, like 7-14 days, so if you end up not eating one on a day you originally planned to, it's not the end of the world. I froze a couple to try to see what they were like after freezing/thawing, and I noticed no changes.\n\nWhen heating up the food, it was never cold in the middle or unevenly cooked. 2 minutes and then an extra minute was always perfect.\n\nOverall I liked my experience and would use it again.

The cucumbers have been arriving looking like they were frozen, completely wet, soft, and unusable. Several of potatoes have been soft and about to go off with little left once all the spots are cut out. Various greens and tomatoes have arrived either already bad or go bad within a day or two of receiving them before we get a chance to use them. \n\nTwo weeks ago the delivery company threw the entire box away because it was \u201cleaking\u201d and then this week the package of marina sauce had exploded on everything in the box.\n\nWhen I complain they give the tiniest refunds that barely cover replacement cost and don\u2019t account for the shipping I paid or the inconvenience of having to go to the store and replace them. They refunded $4 this week for the completely destroyed marinara and 3 onions that weren\u2019t enough for the recipes. The marinara is the main ingredient in the meal which is basically just pasta and bacon without it. Ugh. \n\nAnyone else having the same issues?",

      "title": "CookUnity over Factor (unsolicited)",
      "text": "Background:  I\u2019m a man in my 30\u2019s from the Midwest U.S (many comments on quality seem to mention location playing a role). I wanted a better lunch experience for days I go into the office, but I get fatigued picking out all the different ingredients to keep it interesting when grocery shopping. Buying lunch each day is expensive and the same frozen meals every day is boring. I\u2019m not a DoorDash/uber eats user, so I am not replacing that cost. If you are, this definitely will save you money. I was looking for healthier, better tasting, more various and relatively affordable options for lunch. Maybe a dinner here and there. I tried these companies starting 1/2025.\n\nI\u2019ve had 24 CookUnity meals and 16 factor meals. I have eaten them fresh as well as from frozen. I\u2019ve tried their premium meals (overall not worth the up charge with either company in my opinion). I\u2019ve cooked them in a microwave, air fryer and oven. Eaten them for lunch and dinner (eating truffled fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken from CookUnity for dinner as I type this out), and just got my first breakfast meal options in my most recent order. \n\nI stick with Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Salmon for proteins. \n\nAll in all, CookUnity is a far better experience. \n\nFactor is not terrible and can be better than or atleast a nice change of pace from grocery store frozen or premade meals. So, definitely place an order, get those discount and some free goodies that only factor offers (little juice shots)\n\nWhat I Like about CookUnity:\nQuality- The quality of food is just better with CookUnity. It\u2019s fresher, better texture, and seems like a meal someone would make at home or\u2026even a restaurant. Factor meals seemed less fresh or maybe poorly sourced, the flavor was all from toppings not marinating, and just basic.\n\nVariety: CookUnity has so many different ingredients they use in various dishes. Their chefs take flavors from all over the world and pair them with sides or veggies that fit the theme. Factor just has like \u201cHey! here\u2019s this protein and this side that we have in the inventory that probably go together\u201d\n\nVeggies/Sides/ Variety (continued): The sides really made a difference. CookUnity has Chopped or whole veggies like broccoli, leafy greens, red onions, asparagus, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower\u2026 they have sides like mashed potatoes, red potatoes, Mac n cheese, noodles, and toppings/ sauces in little containers. If you are looking for healthy, you can avoid this stuff, but I freaking love me some sour cream or a side of Mac n cheese. Factor had pretty much the same game plan every time ; Cauliflower rice as a base for their protein and a side of easily microwaveable veggies like broccoli or green beans. And instead of little sauces or toppings, most meals came with a little \u201cbutter scoop\u201d(like those ones at restaurants that sorta look like ice cream\u2026 yes\u2026 I did that once also) of a topping that would melt and disperse over the food as it heated. It usually just soaks into the cauliflower rice making it more mushy.\n\nCooking/ Packaging: they both come in single serving containers, but that\u2019s what we are here for. CookUnity containers are compostable material, while Factor comes in plastic. This means it less environmentally friendly, less healthy after heating (plastics), and more limited. CookUnity meals can be made in the ways I mentioned in my 1st paragraph (don\u2019t put the CookUnity container in a AirFryer unless you have good insurance!), while Factor, due to the sloppy base of cauliflower rice, can really only be heated in the microwave. CookUnity even gives directions for oven and microwave. CookUnity is delivered in a reusable bag that the delivery person with pick up when delivering your next order. Factor is a big box with a cooling pad and insulation lining.\n\nAdvice:\nBe adventurous!: A huge value here is adding variety and eating meals you might never make yourself, so take advantage of that!\n\nThat said, have some guidelines. Stick to proteins you know you will like or look for atleast one ingredient you know you know you will like even if the rest of the dish is a mystery. With factor, always choose whole proteins. Their diced or sliced proteins always tend be mushy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the meal, call the company and tell them!!! They will credit you the cost of the meal almost every time. Both companies have pretty friendly customer service teams.\n\nTake Advantage of your discounts!: Order as many meals as makes sense based on pricing, especially for CookUnity. Maybe not factor, but that\u2019s my biased, which is everything so far anyways. After so many meals in an order, they start to go up in price due to shipping and the company not wanting to get totally burned. I\u2019ve found that 14-18 meals gives you the best price point. Sure, from frozen is never better than from fresh, but if you are already eating frozen meals, that\u2019s a non-factor.\n\nPause your order: unless you plan to eat all those meals in a week, you will want to pause your order. If not, they will send you another shipment next week, with or without you selecting meals.\n\nYes, pause your order before canceling. Especially if you are brand hopping. Most of the companies will offer you more discounts when you try to cancel. If you are brand hopping, use their initial discounts while pause the companies you\u2019ve already used. Once you\u2019ve cycled through all the companies you want to try, go back and cancel the 1st one you went to, take the discount and stock up again! You can make these discounts last a really long time if you do this.\n\nBe sorta thoughtful about which meals might freeze better than others. When I get my order, I immediately freeze a large portion and keep a few in my fridge for the upcoming week. Example, I don\u2019t think leafy greens freeze well, so I eat those 1st. I think they will all freeze and reheat fine, but, maybe give it some consideration.\n\nI am not paid by CookUnity on anything, just really happy I found them. But hey, if someone at CookUnity sees this, I\u2019m totally down to write more reviews in exchange for discounts! Comment below!\n\nI have not tried any of the others: Tempo by homechef, hello fresh\u2019s or blue apron\u2019s new line or the few others out there. I also have not tried the packaged meals from HelloFresh or Blue Apron. I think I might give HelloFresh and Blue Apron a try in the future once I\u2019m done getting all I can out of these companies. They have been around awhile and I have heard decent things about them or been recommended by friend to try their packaged meals. If anyone wants to build some callouses on their fingers and give me a run down on those groups, please do.\n\nMaybe, I\u2019ll come back with more info and edit or comment later, but that\u2019s all I can think of for now. \n\nThanks for coming to my T.E.D talk.",

      "title": "Honest Review of Hungryroot",
      "text": "To preface this post - I am a former HelloFresh customer, I paid for HelloFresh for over a year but the recipes are limited after so long and the cook/prep time took too long. I switched to Hungryroot in mid-December and have received three boxes from them. \n\nI'll be breaking down this review into three parts 1.Meal and grocery options 2.Time/Prep 3.Cost.\n\n1. Meal and Grocery options 8/10\nI have no dietary restrictions that require me to use Hungryroot, since they largely advertise being a better option for people with restrictions. For someone without restrictions who wants to live/eat healthier the meal options are great. I enjoy the organic part of the service, grass fed and sustainability sourced meats and in three boxes I havent had an issue with the quality of produce. The produce comes extremely fresh, and the card included in the subscription gives you use-by dates on all of the meat and produce. I struggle with creating recipes which is why I choose meal kits over grocery shopping, their recipes have overall been tasty and very simple. I enjoy the grocery part of the service, I live a \"grab and go\" life when it comes to breakfast and they have plenty of pre-made options for my lifestyle. The snacks are good as well, but I find myself picking from the kids section for those.\n\n2. Time/ Prep 10/10\nThis was a very large aspect of switching for me, HelloFresh recipes took a very long time to cook despite their 20 minutes or less options. I have yet to cook a Hungryroot meal that takes me longer than 30 minutes. In my last box I ordered a lot of \"bowls\" the vegetables for these options came pre-sliced and packaged which is incredibly convenient. They have a variety of options for pre-cooked meats that are heat and eat, but I've largely avoided these out of fear. \n\n3. Cost 2/10\nThis is the reason I am canceling my Hungryroot subscription. That probably wasn't what you were expecting at the end of this review, but it's very evident the service overcharges. I've subscribed to Factor, HomeChef and HelloFresh in the past by far Hungryroot is the most expensive for a single person. Their meals and groceries are based off of a point system, so you never actually see how much you are paying for itmes. I paid $150/week for one person, focusing my subscription on dinners and breakfast since these are the only two meals I eat during the day. I decided to do a cost breakdown on how much it would be to purchase everything from Walmart that I received in my first box, the cost went from $150 to $102. There isn't a huge price gap, however, the quanity purchased from a grocery store is much different than a meal subscription service. For the cost of 8oz of Italian sausage through Hungryroot I could buy 1lb from Walmart and have multiple meals. I understand that subscription services are meant as a convenience, so we expect to pay extra, but in my opinion Hungryroot isn't worth it for the quanity you receive. \n\nHopefully this review was clear, I'm open to answering any questions on the service or the others I have mentioned in this post!

      "text": "**The good:**\n\n* The promotional price was insanely low.  $12 for 6 prepared meals AND 6 large chocolate chip cookies.  And free shipping!\n* The meals were filling, around 500-700 calories each.\n* The cookies were easy to make (just throw in the toaster oven for 15 minutes) and delicious!  And quite decent ingredients, too, like real vanilla and nothing sketchy!\n\n**The really really awful**\n\n* The meals were not even remotely nutritionally balanced.  Slivers of veg at most.\n* Their texture was honestly the worst I have ever experienced in a prepared meal, and that includes airplane meals.  If the King of Thailand had the misfortune of trying Gobble's pad thai, I think he would sentence the entire Gobble team to a terrible fate that I'm not sure I can mention on Reddit.  Among other things, the shrimp could be used either to make childrens' bouncy balls OR, I'm convinced, transmogrified into fishy &amp; dangerous weapons of great destruction.\n* Worse still, the meals' flavor profile... was also worse than the worst prepared meals I can ever remember eating.  And to put this in perspective, I've tried lots of delivery options like Tovala (pricey but pretty good!), CookUnity (not bad), HomeChef (mixed), and Factor (oof, no) by mail, and various frozen foods at the grocery store (which have generally been... okay, not great).\n\nSomehow Gobble managed to make even mac and cheese -- one of those foods where even when it's mediocre it's still typically a guilty pleasure -- be such so mushy and flavorless that I could barely force myself to finish it.  And that was one of the, ahem, less awful Gobble meals.\n\nHOW bad are they?  I ate 5, regret eating those 5, and am finally sensibly composting the 6th one.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have access to the same promotional pricing I did, I actually (semi-seriously) suggest you buy this anonymously for someone you hate.  It's a cheap enough evil 'gift' that may torture the other person up to 6 times (!).\n\nJust don't include the chocolate chip cookies, since as noted, those were actually delightful.",

      "text": "This is basically a rant, but I'm just so frustrated. My wife and I have tried about 5 different meal kit companies over the past few years. To my understanding, a lot of the companies have regional contracts with couriers/driver companies depending on where you live. All five meal kit companies we've tried so far are with the same courier service, and we've canceled our subscription to these meal kit companies because of this courier service. \n\nWe've lived in two different apartments and in both the last and current one, our meal kits have been delivered to completely different addresses (one was in an entirely different zip code that we've never even lived at before) about once every two months by these couriers, which really threw us off because we relied on those kits with our hectic schedules. This is despite me putting in VERY specific instructions and landmarks on how to find our unit every time I get a notification that the delivery is dispatched. \n\nWe swore off the kits for a while until a few months ago, when I decided to sign up for HomeChef. They used the same courier service in my area, but I wanted to see if maybe they got their act together. It went well for about three months, then suddenly misdeliveries again. Had one sent to a different address back in December, and then it happened again today. I'm pissed. Homechef gave me a voucher for a free box for my next delivery the first time it happened, but I messaged them this afternoon just asking me for a refund because it's essentially a gamble now of whether I'll actually get my damn boxes or not. I'm waiting to hear back but man, I'm so pissed. \n\nAnyone else have to deal with constant misdeliveries with their meal kits? This is ridiculous.",

Pine nuts is a common pesto ingredient and we have a nut allergy in our home. Food produced on the same machinery as nuts is fine, but actual nuts are not.

It sat in my buildings foyer all day until I finally came and unpacked it. It was packed in their insulated box with four ice packs, all which were partially melted but I\u2019d still say they were all at least 75% frozen. The food was cool but not frozen, however I don\u2019t think it was supposed to be it was supposed to be refrigerated. My question is, is it safe? I\u2019m fairly new to eating meat so I really wouldn\u2019t know if it was safe to eat or not by smell or appearance. Any thoughts?",

The meals were exceptional, interesting and always fresh and exciting.   Out of curiosity I tried to check out their latest menues.   I had to log in but I looked at menus to see what it would cost.   I then suspended my account and emailed them telling them not to charge my card nor ship anything.   They acknowledged both facts.  Three days later guess what, a package shows up and my card is charged.\n\nNow I email them to request an explanation and Shenna T., a customer service representative in Charlotte NC never answers.   To me this company is now a living cheating, FTC violating company.  \nProbably happened when Kroger took over, but what the original startup founders had it, when it started, when I was with them 12 years ago they were good.\n\nThe last meal has the tiniest shrimp I have ever seen,   Long stringy overgrown and wilted spinach even on the day it was received.   Roma tomatoes that were the most flavorless I have ever tasted.   I should have swapped them for my small wonders from the backyard garden.\n\nI don\u2019t get it.  I used this company before and was so impressed in 2013.  Now, how much has changed.  I guess that happens when one company buys another, but fraudulently charging me is not going to happen.   FTC complaint and class action lawsuit on its way.\n\nFinally I suggested to have my business I would need single servings and the ability to save money by having shipments every two weeks and getting about 6 meals.

It was about 30min until I was able to get it inside and start unpacking it. \n\nThe two ice packs on top were melted but still cold. All the produce and sides seemed totally fine. And the proteins were on the bottom on top of 3 ice packs that were still about half frozen. It seemed like they had started to warm a bit so I unpacked and temped them. The chicken was at 40F which is the top of the safe range, and both the salmon and trout were around 50F which is outside of the safe zone but both smelled fine and seemed like they hadn\u2019t been in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d for very long at all. \n\nThe tempo meals, however, were packed on the side of the box that was left upright. They were barely cold. I haven\u2019t opened or smelled any of them and there\u2019s a chance they could be fine, but I went ahead and reached out to customer support to see if I could get reimbursed for the tempo meals. \n\nCustomer support was awesome, they responded promptly, and even though I\u2019m confident this issue was 100% on the Fed Ex driver for leaving the box on its side (I think had it been delivered upright, the temp would have held fine) they said not to use anything that was under 40F and credited the whole order.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy with the delivery experience and I think of the next driver just delivers the box upright like they\u2019re supposed to, future deliveries should be totally fine. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "text": "I have debated writing this post, knowing it won\u2019t do much but today was the last straw and I\u2019m tired of taking it out on the hardworking customer service reps. HelloFresh changed my life and eating habits so this is really disappointing, but I can\u2019t keep justifying throwing $90 out the door every week. \n\nHelloFresh has significantly declined in quality the last year. I don\u2019t know if there was a change in leadership or ownership but regardless, I am appalled at how quickly the ingredients and service and customer experience degraded. And there has been 0 effort to right the wrongs.\n\n- my box this week has not been delivered, no updates on the status until I called. Only to find out it might not be delivered at all. Instead I\u2019m offered $15 in credits which does NOTHING to help the fact I have 0 meals for this week \n\n- my ingredients have routinely showed up moldy and rotting (ingredients like an onion, which take forever to go bad - how long was it sitting there) or the ingredients come water damaged or with freezer burn (zucchinis, carrots etc)\n\n- last week I was really excited to make a pasta only to find the cream sauce base exploded everywhere, therefore I could not make my pasta without it\n\n- during black history month I selected all my meals, and I was particularly excited about the bbq chicken and mac n cheese. That week I open the app only to find all my meal selections have been RESET. Nothing I chose was ordered. I furiously call and try to right this before the box ships out. I speak to someone who helps me fix my selections yet when my box shows up next week my meals are STILL WRONG. \n\n- don\u2019t even bother ordering the 15min easy prep single pan meals unless you want mushy goo that tastes like olive garden\n\n- I noticed on the recipe cards they changed all the previous terminology \u201colive oil\u201d with \u201ccooking oil\u201d and this is the biggest indicator and confirmation to me that the quality has declined, HelloFresh is cheap  and trying to appeal to a lower income customer. \n\nPEACE YALLLL see you blue aprons site ",

      "title": "Blue Apron v. Hello Fresh",
      "text": "I\u2019m posting this comparison in both Blue Apron and Hello Fresh subs. I get both meal kits delivered alternating weeks and have used the services for three months. Hello Fresh (HF) delivers to me on Saturday, and Blue Apron (BA) on Friday.\u00a0 I enjoy both and will continue to get both because they have different strengths. I am single and order two meals per week, and they last for a minimum of four dinners.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSingle? Blue Apron or both, like me!\n\nFamily?\u00a0 Hello Fresh\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Overall Winner: Hello Fresh**\u00a0\n\n**Recipe Quality**\n\nFresh meats and veggies from both.\n\nHF offers more family-friendly foods with the same base: chicken, pork, potato wedges, mashed potatoes, and broccoli.\n\nBA offers much fancier recipes with unusual ingredients \u2013 perfect for impressing a date or cooking together. I love eating fancy foods with flair!\n\nWinner: BA\n\n**Number of recipes**\n\nHands down, HF offers far more recipes.\u00a0 For 3/15/25, there are approximately 62 meals, six of those are prepared microwaveable meals, and three are prep and bake.\n\nBA offers 20 options. Two are ready to cook, and none are microwaveable.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Premium meals**\n\nBecause HF offers many more meals, more are premium than BA. From my experience, all of the meals involving fish are considered premium and cost more (approximately $9 more per serving). BA routinely includes fish in its base price (shrimp, codfish, tilapia, and salmon) and I love fish and not having to pay extra for it with BA.\n\nLooking at the menu, BA offers only one premium meal: Duck Confit &amp; Coconut Curry Ramen, which costs $18.98 per serving.\u00a0\n\nHF has six premium meals, including Shoyu-Style Ramen with Sesame-Soy Salmon for 8.99 per service.\n\nThe recipes HF charges extra for would typically be part of BA\u2019s base plan.\u00a0 I have not ordered premium meals from either.\n\nWinner: Tie.\u00a0 HF is cheaper and has more options.\u00a0 But fish is standard fare for BA and is always offered.\n\n**Specialty Meals:**\n\nLooking for big-batch meals, casseroles, or slow-cooker options: HF.\u00a0 BA doesn\u2019t offer these.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Add ons:**\u00a0\n\nBoth have upsells after you\u2019ve selected your meals for the week, but HF has many more options: smoothies (sometimes sold out), breakfast items, and decadent desserts.\u00a0 I\u2019ve ordered desserts from HF twice: blueberry cake and hazelnut cheesecake.\u00a0 I ordered one and received two servings of each. The cake was microwaveable. Both were delicious but high in calories and fat, which isn\u2019t viewable online.\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Order correctness**\n\nThere have been no issues with HF yet. BA has sent me the wrong delivery once. I was looking forward to my salmon meal, too. Instead of one, I received three meals instead of two, including fried chicken, falafel salad, and chorizo enchiladas. I try to stay on the lighter side of calories, but of course, I made the dishes. BA responded quickly via email and refunded my meal for that week.\u00a0\n\nWinner:\u00a0 HF\n\n**Packaging**\u00a0\n\nI love HF\u2019s packaging!\u00a0 Both of my recipes come in separate brown paper bags. I can just open the box and pop the bags in the fridge.\u00a0 Look underneath the cardboard divider for meats and pop in the freezer.\u00a0\n\nBA just tosses all the individual ingredients in a box like: YOU figure it out!\u00a0\n\nI like that BA lets you know the ice product is sink-friendly.\u00a0 HF does not say that, so I toss the heavy packaging.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**App**\u00a0\n\nBoth apps are easy to navigate and have the recipes cards in the app in the event you lose yours.\u00a0 They both have filters so you can get to your low-calorie, vegetarian or Bestseller meals quickly. I like that HF's front menu page shows the calorie content.\u00a0\n\nWinner HF\u00a0\n\n**Repetitiveness**\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been using the services for three months and still haven\u2019t bought the same meal twice, although I easily could. Because HF has so many options, many are repeated often. The Honey Onion Crunch Chicken is almost always on the menu. That was my first dish, and it is an easy-to-make one-pan meal and delicious! I can\u2019t wait to have it again.\u00a0\n\nBA doesn\u2019t repeat meals as often, but its unique ingredients make regular appearances. So, it has multiple recipes that use the same ingredients in its stock.\n\nWinner: BA has less repetitive/boring recipes even if they reuse ingredients.\n\n**Affordability**\u00a0\n\nI order two meals each week from each (which is four meals). I think I\u2019m still getting a discount from HF and pay about $55. BA is $10-12 more. Sometimes, with HF, I order an extra microwaveable meal for about $8 (two meals). When my HF discount is over, I should be paying about $10 more.\u00a0\n\nBA is more expensive. But the quality of their food and recipes justify the price. I do wish they\u2019d spend money on brown paper bags for individual recipes like HF.\u00a0\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\n\n**Taste**\u00a0\n\nBoth have good meals, and I\u2019m saving all of my recipe cards in a binder and making notes on them (although you can save them in the app, too.)\u00a0 Nothing has been awful, just items I don\u2019t prefer: like lettuce wraps from HF.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, that\u2019s Blue Apron.\n\nWinner:\u00a0 BA\n\n",

      "title": "First few weeks of HelloFresh meals",
      "text": "So far my meals have been great. I have had one minor delivery issue and one ingredient issue. The delivery issue was that my box showed up too late to make a meal that day when I was anticipating doing so\u2013but now I know to have a backup plan. The ingredient issue was a missing 20 oz package of ground beef from one box, which they gave me a $15 credit for. Not the end of the world, easy to replace, but pretty annoying nonetheless. On the other hand, the food has been yummy and I\u2019m planning on continuing for the foreseeable future. \n\nThe meals I have tried so far are:\n\n1. Salmon and lemony spaghetti with Brussels sprouts, sprinkled with toasted panko and scallions \u2014 9/10 \u2014 a strong start! The noodles were tasty, the Brussels sprouts were a nice surprise and addition to the dish, and the burst of lemon really brightened the dish up. The toasty panko breadcrumbs were the perfect finishing touch and added such a nice texture to the pasta. I accidentally over-salted the breadcrumbs while toasting which is totally on me and I will be more careful to not make this mistake again in the future. The salmon was pretty simple and really yummy. \n\n2. Sweet chili beef bowls with jasmine rice, bell pepper and candied peanuts \u2014 10/10 \u2014 this dish was amazing and hit all the right notes for me. The red bell pepper was a perfect companion to the beef and flavors of this dish, though I will probably add shredded carrots when I make it on my own. Speaking of making it on my own, this dish was so tasty that immediately upon finishing my bowl, I went to google to find and order sweet soy glaze online to be able to recreate. An instant fave! I added smashed avocado to this and it was phenomenal, a nice creamy texture and rich buttery flavor against the backdrop of the sweet and savory meat and veggie mixture and fragrant jasmine rice. I would double or triple the candied peanuts when I make in the future because they were a delicious crunchy topping that I would have loved more of!\n\n3. Coconut curry pork noodle soup with bok choy, Napa cabbage and lime \u2014 9/10 \u2014 I love all things ramen and this was no exception. I added extra broth using veggie broth from my pantry to this because I like my ramen brothier than how this came together. The curry was a nice touch and gave the broth such a rich flavor that complimented the pork. I would throw on some sesame seeds if I make this again. \n\n4. Paprika chicken in a lemony sauce with pistachio rice and roasted green beans \u2014 10/10 \u2014 um, yum! The paprika chicken was so simple and flavorful and delicious. I never knew I needed pistachio rice in my cooking arsenal, but here we are\u2013it was great! I hadn\u2019t roasted green beans before but I sure will again. That covers everything but the lemon pan sauce, but I saved the best for last and oh. My. God. I love lemon on a good day but this is what my lemony dreams are made of. I ended up spooning the thin sauce over each component of the meal, and honestly would have probably drank it if that was a thing. I\u2019ve never had lemon and paprika together before so I didn\u2019t know what to expect but it was a scrumptious pairing. The smoky flavor of the paprika was enhanced by the bright citrusy burst of the lemon and actually kind of reminded me of sumac seasoning which is both smoky and citrusy. A great meal that I will come back to again! \n\n5. Fully loaded pork taquitos with pico de gallo and creamy guacamole \u2014 9/10 \u2014 this was a great recipe because I love taquitos but had never made them myself before and now have the confidence to do so. They were really simple to put together, though time consuming to brush 12 tortillas with olive oil, front and back. I liked baking them in the oven and not having to deal with deep frying, and they did get so crispy! Some of the tortillas even puffed up a bit making crispy air pockets which were fun to bite in to. The cold creamy guacamole and chunky pico de gallo topping the hot taquitos fresh out of the oven was such a yummy combination of flavors, temps and textures. \n\n6. Firecracker meatballs with roasted green beans and jasmine rice \u2014 10/10 \u2014 I liked the inclusion of fresh ginger in these meatballs, that was a nice touch. This was the meal that I was missing the package of ground beef for so I replaced it with a package from my local grocery store. I couldn\u2019t find a 20 oz package so I ended up with a much larger amount, which was fine, more leftovers. I didn\u2019t think to grab extra ginger, though, so I ended up having to supplement with some powdered ginger. I like that the meatballs and green beans baked in the oven together. I increased the amount of sauce I made to account for the extra meatballs. The Jasmine rice and roasted green beans were pretty straight forward, but made the perfect backdrop for these saucy meatballs. The sauce was crazy good, a little sweet, a little spicy, a whole lotta delicious, and you bet your booty I\u2019ll be making this dish again!  \n\n7. Szechuan beef noodles with scallions and sesame seeds \u2014 10/10 \u2014 I\u2019m daydreaming of eating this yummy noodle dish again. The Szechuan flavored sauce was quite tasty, savory with a touch of sweetness and a small kick of heat. The noodles made this a hearty meal and the shredded carrots and red cabbage was a nice addition. As you can see from my picture, I was a bit overzealous with the sesame seeds (whoops) but this was an excellent meal nevertheless! \n\nOverall, I am quite pleased with the meals. Lots of yummy flavors, tasty recipes and interesting techniques that I learned by making these meals. I will probably always zest my lemons and limes forever more thanks to HelloFresh. I used to be a Plated customer back in the day and briefly did Blue Apron. I have a big binder full of those recipes and it\u2019s been nice to add some new recipes in after all this time. Thanks for reading if you made it this far!",

      "title": "My experience with HelloFresh",
      "text": "First of all, let me say that this is only the 2nd meal delivery service that I've used, the first being Blue Apron. Comparing the two, I had far less issue with food quality and ingredients, more straightforward billing, and much better tasting recipes from Blue Apron. That being said, HelloFresh hasn't been terrible, but there are a few things that really bother me and seem like very bad business practices, especially compared to my experience with Blue Apron.\n\nFirst, the way that the discount scales is a bit misleading. With Blue Apron, it was a flat discount on each box until the promo ended. With HelloFresh it's a bigger discount up front and then it gets less and less each week until it's over. Not a huge deal really, but still not what I was expecting. Also, when my box for the current week has shipped, it doesn't show me the cost on the menu page when clicking the receipt button. It shows it for previous and future orders when pressing the same icon, but not for the current one. I have to go to order history to see what I was charged for the current box. Again, not a big deal but still poor design imo.\n\nNext is how bad or missing ingredients are handled. With both HelloFresh and Blue Apron I was surprised with how easy it was to report and how generous the credits are. If just one ingredient was bad or missing I got a $10+ credit with both services. However, with Blue Apron the credit is applied to the next box ordered regardless of if you are on a promo or getting discounts. With HelloFresh, they will not let you use the credits until after your promos are finished. This means with the 6 week promo that I used, 4 of which I've had issues with ingredients, I am unable to use those credits until the 7th week. \n\nBut now it's week 7 and the credits still weren't applied? Why? Because I was given a $15 bonus for ordering for 6 weeks to go towards a premium meal selection. Upon using that bonus, it takes away my ability to use $45ish in credits, in the end making me pay more for my meal than I would have, had I not used the \"bonus\" they gave me for doing the whole 6 weeks. So now I have to get an 8th week just to get the credits used for the mistakes they made when sending me food.\n\nLastly, I just went back to look at my order history. On the order history page for each shipment it shows the box price (after taxes and discounts) and the delivery price, along with the total charge. For every week except for the first week, adding up the box price plus the delivery price adds up to .70 less than what the total says. So I've been overcharged for 6 weeks now at .70 per week. It's not a lot of money obviously, but it made me wonder if I was missing something.\n\nSo I requested invoices be sent to my email for each week to verify and see if there was some hidden surcharge. When I check the invoices it shows original box price, discounts applied, delivery price, taxes, and total. The total shown on every invoice after the first week is indeed .70 less than what the total says on the order history page of the website and .70 less than what I was charged each week. I contacted their support through the online chat and it ended up being a waste of an hour of my life, ending up in the chat having an error and upon pressing the reload button, the chat was lost and it wanted me to restart.\n\nAbout 25 minutes into the online chat I realized that the rep was just giving me generic copy paste responses and not actually reading what I was telling him, never addressing the .70 upcharge at all the entire time. They just kept saying I had add-ons, which are charged separately and not even on the invoices in question, and saying the price changes each week because of the discount, which still doesn't address the discrepancy at all. It was going nowhere so I called the phone number instead while still chatting with the agent. Also, the chat agent would only respond once every 5 minutes or so and when I questioned it, they said it was because they were required to help 3 customers at a time and were therefor bouncing between chats.\n\nDuring my talk on the phone they repeated all of the same things that the chat agent had and I explained how each had nothing to do with the .70 discrepancy. They eventually put me on hold and pulled up the detailed charges in their system. When they got back on the phone with me they read me the invoice for the first week in question. Their invoice did not match the invoice that I was emailed. The discount amount she read me was more than what was on my invoice, and the tax amount was higher than what was on my invoice. When I questioned it she assured me that I was charged correctly, despite the invoice I was sent and the website saying otherwise. Eventually, after 25 minutes on the phone I was told it would be escalated to a supervisor and I requested a call back. \n\nThe chat agent said they were going to get a supervisor involved as well around the same time (after almost an hour and only about 10 total responses from them) and then less than a minute later the chat errored out and told me to refresh. When I refreshed the chat history was gone and it wanted me to start a new chat with a different agent. I couldn't even download the chat log because it had been cleared in the refresh.\n\nAll in all, I just feel like the whole system is just sloppy and not handled well. I spent an hour total on the chat and phone and still never got any sort of answer as to why there is a discrepancy between the invoice and the actual amount I was charged. That combined with the repeated ingredient issues, the pricing structure, the withholding of the credits on my account, etc all just add up to an experience that leaves a bad taste in my mouth and in the end I will be canceling my account as soon as my credit is used up next week.",

      "text": "I cancelled HelloFresh last week and switched to BlueApron for the first time. I figured writing down the changes I noticed might be helpful to those who are curious.\n\n\n- Less Meal Choices -\nThe first thing you notice is the decrease in choices. HF normally had 15-20 meals, BA has closer to 10-12.\n\n\n- Heat &amp; Eat options -\nBA offers microwavable \"Heat &amp; Eat\" style meals that you can add to your box.\n\n\n- Cluttered App -\nHF definitely has a more user friendly app for managing your menu. This might just be due to the vertical nature of HF. I much prefer it.\n\n\n- My first box was delayed a day -\nNot a huge deal, but something to keep an eye on. They did send me a helpful email beforehand saying it was delayed.\n\n\n- Same shipping carrier as HF in my area -\nWe had Veho for HF and had a generally good experience. Glad to see BA also uses Veho in our area (Washington DC).\n\n\n- Ingredients are kinda sorted -\nHF ships everything you need for a meal in a paper bag. BA doesn't do this. They ship all of the produce loose in the box, and then other items are included grouped in bags depending on the recipe. They call these \"Knick Knacks\" for some reason.\n\n\n- Way more plastic packaging -\nCompared to HF, I was surprised how much plastic waste is included. The soy sauce comes in little plastic bottles, the seafood comes in plastic trays. Most of the sauces come in little plastic dishes instead of HF pouches.\n\n\n- Protein is way better -\nThe packaging and quality of the protein is significantly better. The salmon and shrimp came in nice plastic trays, and the chicken came individually bagged to prevent the juices from getting on everything. In addition to the packaging, the actual protein tasted better. The salmon in particular was bigger and more flavorful than HF.\n\n\n- Recipes are a bit more involved -\nGeneral wisdom has been that BA is a bit more difficult than HF, and I agree with that. There are definitely less recipes that use seasoning pouches/flavoring packets, and the meals tend to require a bit more finesse. I think the recipe cards are not as user friendly as HF, the print in smaller and they're much closer to a traditional cookbook in style.\n\n\n- The food does taste better -\nAt the end of the day, of the meals we've had so far, BA comes out a pretty clear winner in terms of meal quality. Last night we had a Sambal Salmon with pickles carrots and peppers and a cilantro-rice which was easily better than any HF seafood meal I've had.",

In addition, last week we got an ingredient packet for Curried Salmon with Chickpeas (which we didn't order) but of course no salmon!\n\nWhen we went to report these issues, we were directed to text them and didn't receive a response for five days!\n\nThis week our box arrived missing one of four recipes (again, the one we were most looking forward to). Soon after the box was delivered, we did get an email saying that \"due to unforeseen inventory contraints\" they were unable to include that recipe and issued a credit to our account.\n\nIt seems BA is having some real problems doing the one thing they endeavor to do: put ingredients into a box! I'm not saying this is easy, but after so many years you'd think they would have developed processes and quality control procedures to insure that boxes are correct before they leave the warehouse. I can't remember the last time an Amazon order was incorrect.\n\nIs anyone else experiences what we are?",

But more recently, we had headache after headache, due to our food cartons being delivered a day late, thanks to the dreadful service we get from the FEDEX Orlando hub to zip code 32608, our fair city.\n\nI complained loudly to both FEDEX and BLUE APRON, and I begged Blue Apron Customer Service and FEDEX Customer Service to escalate my complaints, to have theirr regional managers speak to each other, because FEDEX kept delivering us spoiled meals where the ice packs were melted. \n\nBlue Apron even moved our ship-out day back one day to Wednesday for a Thursday delivery, but for the 6th or 7th time, it arrived a day late and was ruined.  (See pic.)  The salmon was hot to the touch (\"Don't Eat the Salmon! Don't Eat the Salmon!\")\n\nPart of the problem may be that Blue Apron is in NJ, we're in North Central FL, and they are using FEDEX Home Delivery, instead of an Express service. In addition, literally nothing on the outside of the BA carton says \"PERISHABLE\" \"REFRIGERATED\" or indicates it is food that will spoil.\n\nIn any case, the service from Blue Apron and FEDEX is so enshittified that we opted to just cancel outright after 3 years as BA weekly customers. It's the final straw.\n\nIf anyone in North Central Florida can recommend a different meal service, perhaps one with a D.C. in my area, that would be helpful.\n\n",

I\u2019ve done different meal kits in the past such as home chef, factor, and blue apron.\n\nTo start off, i\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t really look at calories and things like that. I just picked things that sounded good. Upon really looking at everything it all seems so high in calories which still doesn\u2019t bother me except today I opened the Lemon Caper Chicken with Fettuccine and parmesan cheese. I\u2019m just shocked that this is 990 cal for the amount that it is it just doesn\u2019t seem calculated correctly especially because I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot of sauce on this to cover the noodles.\n\nThe reason I was kind of drawn in to cook unity was because there were so many options. Which is one of the reasons I stopped using Factor was it felt like the same meals every week. However, I\u2019m more than halfway through the meals that I ordered and they all just seem so bland. \nI\u2019m just wondering if maybe the quality has gone down or what other peoples opinions are I also got the free cookies for life when I signed up however, my cookie was smashed a bits from the packaging which also was not great. They said it would be delivered between 12 and eight on Sunday and I don\u2019t think it would have been cold and fresh had I not been home majority of the ice was kind of melted already. \n\nI\u2019ve made sure I\u2019ve paused it, but curious to know what some people\u2019s favorites are I tried to do a variety of Mexican-American Asian dishes with a protein and a carb or protein and veggie.

      "text": "After a couple of years using some of the more popular meal delivery services something has really been bothering me lately.  I honestly think we need to revolt against the hidden 'last mile delivery\" that they all employ.  In my experience, and, from what I have read here, most people's experience is that: most of the services are decent.  When the food is delivered, and by whom, is determinate.  Depending on where you live and what day you ask for a delivery the food can be good, cold, and edible.  Or, as we all know, it can be warm, not edible, and have an ability to make us violently sick.  No one seems to be able to tell us, until we try, what service will deliver the \"last mile'.  NO !  They know from your address and zip code who will deliver to you on a certain day.  So far I have contacted [Gooble.com](http://Gooble.com) (my favorite..) to discover that my only last mile deliverer is OnTrak...a delivery service I personally abhor because they don't reach my neck of the woods until 8-9 pm.  I am at the absolute end of their delivery day. But I tried them for three weeks until I realized that the time and temperature were unacceptable.  And this is my point...why are we actually asked to choose a date without knowing what time the food will arrive when the company knows ???? Blue Apron, my next favorite, is also a OnTrak only deliverer.  So at least I know now.  But why am I forced to do all this research work when a competent company should be (IMHO) be forthcoming with this info so that we can make intelligent decisions?  This is my small rebellion.

      "title": "CookUnity over Factor (unsolicited)",
      "text": "Background:  I\u2019m a man in my 30\u2019s from the Midwest U.S (many comments on quality seem to mention location playing a role). I wanted a better lunch experience for days I go into the office, but I get fatigued picking out all the different ingredients to keep it interesting when grocery shopping. Buying lunch each day is expensive and the same frozen meals every day is boring. I\u2019m not a DoorDash/uber eats user, so I am not replacing that cost. If you are, this definitely will save you money. I was looking for healthier, better tasting, more various and relatively affordable options for lunch. Maybe a dinner here and there. I tried these companies starting 1/2025.\n\nI\u2019ve had 24 CookUnity meals and 16 factor meals. I have eaten them fresh as well as from frozen. I\u2019ve tried their premium meals (overall not worth the up charge with either company in my opinion). I\u2019ve cooked them in a microwave, air fryer and oven. Eaten them for lunch and dinner (eating truffled fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken from CookUnity for dinner as I type this out), and just got my first breakfast meal options in my most recent order. \n\nI stick with Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Salmon for proteins. \n\nAll in all, CookUnity is a far better experience. \n\nFactor is not terrible and can be better than or atleast a nice change of pace from grocery store frozen or premade meals. So, definitely place an order, get those discount and some free goodies that only factor offers (little juice shots)\n\nWhat I Like about CookUnity:\nQuality- The quality of food is just better with CookUnity. It\u2019s fresher, better texture, and seems like a meal someone would make at home or\u2026even a restaurant. Factor meals seemed less fresh or maybe poorly sourced, the flavor was all from toppings not marinating, and just basic.\n\nVariety: CookUnity has so many different ingredients they use in various dishes. Their chefs take flavors from all over the world and pair them with sides or veggies that fit the theme. Factor just has like \u201cHey! here\u2019s this protein and this side that we have in the inventory that probably go together\u201d\n\nVeggies/Sides/ Variety (continued): The sides really made a difference. CookUnity has Chopped or whole veggies like broccoli, leafy greens, red onions, asparagus, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower\u2026 they have sides like mashed potatoes, red potatoes, Mac n cheese, noodles, and toppings/ sauces in little containers. If you are looking for healthy, you can avoid this stuff, but I freaking love me some sour cream or a side of Mac n cheese. Factor had pretty much the same game plan every time ; Cauliflower rice as a base for their protein and a side of easily microwaveable veggies like broccoli or green beans. And instead of little sauces or toppings, most meals came with a little \u201cbutter scoop\u201d(like those ones at restaurants that sorta look like ice cream\u2026 yes\u2026 I did that once also) of a topping that would melt and disperse over the food as it heated. It usually just soaks into the cauliflower rice making it more mushy.\n\nCooking/ Packaging: they both come in single serving containers, but that\u2019s what we are here for. CookUnity containers are compostable material, while Factor comes in plastic. This means it less environmentally friendly, less healthy after heating (plastics), and more limited. CookUnity meals can be made in the ways I mentioned in my 1st paragraph (don\u2019t put the CookUnity container in a AirFryer unless you have good insurance!), while Factor, due to the sloppy base of cauliflower rice, can really only be heated in the microwave. CookUnity even gives directions for oven and microwave. CookUnity is delivered in a reusable bag that the delivery person with pick up when delivering your next order. Factor is a big box with a cooling pad and insulation lining.\n\nAdvice:\nBe adventurous!: A huge value here is adding variety and eating meals you might never make yourself, so take advantage of that!\n\nThat said, have some guidelines. Stick to proteins you know you will like or look for atleast one ingredient you know you know you will like even if the rest of the dish is a mystery. With factor, always choose whole proteins. Their diced or sliced proteins always tend be mushy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the meal, call the company and tell them!!! They will credit you the cost of the meal almost every time. Both companies have pretty friendly customer service teams.\n\nTake Advantage of your discounts!: Order as many meals as makes sense based on pricing, especially for CookUnity. Maybe not factor, but that\u2019s my biased, which is everything so far anyways. After so many meals in an order, they start to go up in price due to shipping and the company not wanting to get totally burned. I\u2019ve found that 14-18 meals gives you the best price point. Sure, from frozen is never better than from fresh, but if you are already eating frozen meals, that\u2019s a non-factor.\n\nPause your order: unless you plan to eat all those meals in a week, you will want to pause your order. If not, they will send you another shipment next week, with or without you selecting meals.\n\nYes, pause your order before canceling. Especially if you are brand hopping. Most of the companies will offer you more discounts when you try to cancel. If you are brand hopping, use their initial discounts while pause the companies you\u2019ve already used. Once you\u2019ve cycled through all the companies you want to try, go back and cancel the 1st one you went to, take the discount and stock up again! You can make these discounts last a really long time if you do this.\n\nBe sorta thoughtful about which meals might freeze better than others. When I get my order, I immediately freeze a large portion and keep a few in my fridge for the upcoming week. Example, I don\u2019t think leafy greens freeze well, so I eat those 1st. I think they will all freeze and reheat fine, but, maybe give it some consideration.\n\nI am not paid by CookUnity on anything, just really happy I found them. But hey, if someone at CookUnity sees this, I\u2019m totally down to write more reviews in exchange for discounts! Comment below!\n\nI have not tried any of the others: Tempo by homechef, hello fresh\u2019s or blue apron\u2019s new line or the few others out there. I also have not tried the packaged meals from HelloFresh or Blue Apron. I think I might give HelloFresh and Blue Apron a try in the future once I\u2019m done getting all I can out of these companies. They have been around awhile and I have heard decent things about them or been recommended by friend to try their packaged meals. If anyone wants to build some callouses on their fingers and give me a run down on those groups, please do.\n\nMaybe, I\u2019ll come back with more info and edit or comment later, but that\u2019s all I can think of for now. \n\nThanks for coming to my T.E.D talk.",

      "text": "Hello Fresh - it started out great but then the meat quickly went down hill and the meals got repetitive. They also started charging more for none repetitive items.  \n\nEvery plate - Hello Fresh with terrible packaging and even less variety. These were my least favorite \n\nSun Basket- fresh and delicious new flavors and easy recipes. The portions are smaller but we loved it. Then we had children and we didn\u2019t find things our picky eater would eat. It is still one of our favorites \n\nMarley Spoon - very big portions, we always have left overs and there are a huge selection of dishes. It\u2019s especially great if you like Asian dishes like curry and ramen. They often have a harder to find ingredient that makes it worth it. \n\nDinnerly- less expensive Marley Spoon. They still have a great variety but use a lot more of the same ingredients that are easy and cheaper to find at the grocery store. Dinnerly and Marley Spoon we did the longest\n\nHome Chef- the meals were just ok, the variety was overwhelming at times and the packaging was pretty wasteful. We did this one the shortest amount of time. The meals were boring to us\n\nGobble- tasty but not worth the portion size to dollar ratio. \n\nPurple Carrot- honestly it was good but the recipes were more time consuming and I\u2019m not really vegan. So we only tried one box \n\nMethodology- honestly if it wasn\u2019t so expensive I would eat it everyday day. It\u2019s more of individual food you heat up on the stove but it was so good \n\nSakara- I did the cleanse but really only liked the breakfast options. I did like that the food was fresh and I think delivered two or three times for the week very early in the morning. I can\u2019t say it was worth the price tag. \n\nSilver Spoon- for the most part I enjoyed this but the meals needed a little more seasoning. \n\nGreen Chef- it was better before home chef purchased it. It\u2019s easier to prepare than home chef but it contains a lot of recipes that contain nuts which was a problem for us. \n\nBlue Apron - this was the best middle of the road meal kit for us. You can get fancy meals that were also easy to make kid friendly. The options to upgrade the type of meat were also wonderful. We used this service for a year and it was truly enjoyable. There was also a ton of options every week. There a little more prep than some meals but they were all good. \n\nEvery table- it\u2019s not available everywhere but it was inexpensive and we loved the business model of making healthy food available in underserved areas by charging different pricing in different areas and that our money was also helping those who were food insecure. Some meals were better than others but the portions sizes were nice \n\nDaily Harvest- I hated the meals. The smoothies were good but the meals all got tossed after trying them. \n\nRevive superfoods- we ordered these smoothies for a while and really enjoyed them. They were also less expensive than daily harvest. \n\nHungry root- we have tried this twice. The first time they had mostly hungry root branded foods and Banza noodles.  We really did enjoy how quick and easy the food was to make. The pasta sauces and green chili sauces were great as well. We stopped ordering during the pandemic because we were having trouble getting the boxes.  We recently tried it again and there were so many more options the food was fresh and the sauces were still very good. It\u2019s a nice spot between Gobble\u2019s and more intensive meal services.  It\u2019s not a service for people that want interesting flavors but more for people that need to be able to eat quick and healthy food and snacks but don\u2019t want to think about how to meal plan it or what the ingredients are. \n\n\nYou can ask me about any service and I\u2019ll do my best to answer.  I didn\u2019t realize how many I actually tried until I started writing this.  ",

One recipe only contained like 4 potatoes, 1 packet of sour cream, 1 chicken breast, and 1 bunch of chives.

We get the veggie meals (not vegetarian just trying to eat less meat for the environment) unless one of the meat meals looks way way better. Overall, after doing four weeks of each, we're switching permanently to HF and canceling BA entirely.\n\n**Pros of HelloFresh**: \n\n* The food is just damn tasty, I don't think we had a single meal we didn't love. Excellent use of spices, sauces, different flavors, etc. I really love how it has you use one ingredient multiple ways (for example, sauteeing the white part of scallions, and using the green part for garnish)\n* Excellent variety, both for veggie and non-veggie meals, the recipes are things I would never think to cook myself but now will re-buy the ingredients\n* The little package of ingredients is not necessary but appreciated; I just pull out the bag, versus digging through my fridge for the BA ingredients. I wouldn't pay more for this obviously but since HF and BA are price comparable...\n* Portion size is great, at first I doubted it would be enough but was always full after every meal (just showing that I was eating too much before!)\n* Recipe cards are extraordinarily easy to follow - big pictures, big font, not too many sub-parts\n\n**Cons of HF**: \n\n* More of the meals are higher-calorie (600-900)\n* The freezer pack stuff can't go down the drain?\n\n**Pros of BlueApron**:\n\n* Generally, the meals were lower-calorie, if that's something you care about\n* The freezer pack stuff can go down the drain\n\n**Cons of BlueApron:**\n\n* Bland, uninspired food. One of the worst offenders was this [Chickpea and Curry \"Shakshuka\"](https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/one-pan-chickpea-curry-shakshuka-with-tomatoes-spinach). The only seasoning was \"yellow curry paste\" - no paprika, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, chili powder, anything! And no bread to dip! Other recipes were similarly \"meh\" and just generally lacking flavor. The picture/name always sounded so good, but we were always disappointed with the final result. We generally like bold, spicy/spiced food though so might be an us problem\n* Loose ingredients (again, not a big deal, but HF does the package and costs the same)\n* Recipe cards, for some reason, use tiny font, tons of sub-steps within one step, and infuriatingly have tons of un-used white space!! Much more difficult to follow\n* The options were less exciting, especially the vegetarian options; I think our favorite meals from BA generally included meat. There were usually only 4 veggie options, whereas I think HF sometimes has 5 or 6",

It looks promising.  We did the 'signature for 4' plan..which has the lowest per meal cost and will probably order it around every two weeks like we did for HelloFresh.  I'll have to say that the BlueApron menu looks good so far.   Seems to have a bit more 'variety' than HelloFresh.  However, lets see if I keep saying that in a few months!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "text": "An emerging trend is led by startups such as prepared meals, a subscription service that packages ingredients together with recipes and delivers a kit right to the cook\u2019s doorstep. Kits range in price from $60 to $140 and include up to four recipes a week for a family of four. All ingredients are farm-fresh and pre-measured. With little effort, even a subscriber with no cooking skills can prepare a professional quality meal: [Julia Child Would Be Thrilled: Most Americans Prefer to Cook at Home](https://www.reportlinker.com/insight/americans-cooking-habits.html)\n\nConvenience is a key selling point. Buyers don\u2019t need to shop for dozens of ingredients each week. But another, equally important, reason is health. These services don\u2019t simply offer pre-packaged food, rather, they promise organic, healthy ingredients.\n\nFor beginner cooks, especially Millennials, Blue Apron and other meal-kit delivery services serve up an important advantage: They can teach them how to cook. Seventy percent of subscribers say meal kits have helped them improve their culinary skills.",

I've radically changed my life style about 6 months ago and lost around 30 lbs with my own meal prep! The only problem I've had is my meal getting thawed during my road trip. Well last week my wife ordered one of this Blue Apron meal kit box. They come with a thick padded insulated \"bag\" that can ingeniously fit the shape of the corrugated box in which It is delivered. They are perfect to keep my meal prep frozen or hot and work for hours. I mean I can literally leave my meal 24h in my car, at 80\u00b0F if needed. So I've made some research, asked Blue Apron that wouldn't give me an answer...\nI was about to give up my quest of the ultimate thermal bag when I stumbled upon that instagram account named Coldkeepers_llc with a picture of the \"bag\" in one of the Blue Apron box. I really wanted to share this, I've bought a couple and that definitely changed my life. Food safety is no joke when it comes to maintaining the Cold Chain! \nI hope this find will help someone in the future! Good luck with your meal prep you all!",

      "title": "Honest Hungryroot review",
      "text": "I've been trying Hungryroot for a few months now and here's my review. \n\n1. To start, I have a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions which had me extremely stressed when trying to look up recipes and make food. I was desperate to find something to make my life easier.  I did the quiz on their website and of course they wanted me to pay before seeing the food options. No thanks. I emailed customer service and they basically gave me \"we have a lot of options so give us a try\" answer. Um, no. Not if I don't know if I can eat the food! After some back and forth and a bad review for the rep I finally received the link for all of their food options. I found a few recipes I could eat so I decided to give it a try. Sifting through the food options does become a lot easier after you sign up because you can kind of create your profile and preferences. I do not like this, I wish they were transparent about everything from the beginning.\n2. I've gotten probably 8 boxes by now, 1 has been late and some of the food was bad. I've had a few bad items in multiple boxes. I've always gotten a quick refund with extra for the inconvenience and they say they talked to the packing team. My last box was perfect so hopefully things are improving? We shall see. (Of note: customer service starting after my first interaction has been very good)\n3. I pay about $105 each week for just me. This includes \"points\" for 3 lunches, 4 dinners, and 5-7 servings of sweets. Portion sizes are huge in my opinion. I started stretching this out for almost every meal for the week. I always end up eating somewhere else for 1-2 meals for the week but the food I get from hungryroot lasts me for the rest of the week. If something tells me I can get 2 servings out of it, I can typically make it into 4 meals. I always end up having enough food to feed my husband a few meals out of the week as well.\n4. The food is pretty fresh which is a huge plus for me because I can't eat a lot of preservatives without issues. The downside is it spoils pretty quickly. I had 2 bags of mozzarella cheese in the fridge, one from Hungryroot and one from Walmart. The one from hungryroot has spoiled already in less than 2 months. \n5. 99% of the meals I've gotten take less than 20 minutes to make and are very easy. This is perfect because I really hate cooking and don't have a lot of time anyway. I did get one meal that took forever to make and it was awful so I try to keep to the more simple options. \n6. Most of the food I get is really tasty! I am a very picky eater (on top of everything else lol) so a huge plus for me.\n\nI'm conclusion, I will be keeping my hungryroot subscription because it makes my life so much easier. If I didn't have so many restrictions I probably wouldn't use it because of cost. I did look at quite a lot of meal service options and none of the others are as good for my dietary restrictions. Hope this helps someone looking into it. \n\n",

I remember the first box was huuuge and had a decent amount of snacks and breakfast options. The second box got delivered with all of the refrigerator goods covered in the ice back gel and a few of them busted and we were directed to throw them out. That box was about 3/4 to 1/2 the size of the first one and still had a few more snacks than this one. For example, the first box gave two bags of partake chocolate chip cookies. The second box had a bag of sugar cookies that was bigger than the small snack size of the chocolate chip cookie bags. This box gave a single sleeve of three partake chocolate chip cookies (they are small cookies). There are a few other snacks in this box just not as much as the first or second box.\n\nIt also just seems like less items. Has this happened to anyone else/something to worry about with them?",

      "text": "I have been trying Hungryroot for almost a year now. I was looking for a meal service that provided relatively quick/easy meals with minimal cooking. What I like about them is the ability to order meals (to make) but also groceries and ready-made items. I also like that they seem relatively healthy compared to other options -- more veggie options, organic, etc.\n\nI have had repeat issues with them not sending the right items -- but honestly that would be mild compared to the issues I have now had - repeatedly -- where food was not packed well and so refrigerated items did not arrive cool or cold. I do not live in a hot climate so no real excuse for this.\n\nIt seems like they have gotten worse since I first signed up and/or are cheaping out on ice packs. For my orders I used to usually have a couple of icepacks and lately it's just been one.\n\nBut the real problem is multiple times items were stored in the top of the box without any icepack.\n\nIt is incredibly frustrating to not have the food you planned on eating for the week but what is most upsetting for me is to have to throw out whole packages of food. One of the reasons I justify using mail service is to cut down on waste. \n\nOne thing I will say is that -- unlike other reviews I have read -- I have had zero problems getting ahold of customer service and every single time I have had a complaint they have given me a credit for food, refund, etc. \n\nGetting my money back hasn't been a problem -- but being able to rely on their service doesn't seem to be possible. I'll definitely keep an eye out to see if they make improvements in the future because I really do like their products. ",

      "text": "I know this has been said before but I am now making it my mission to spread this far and wide - if you're considering using Hungry Root, turn back now!!! \n\nThis was by FAR the worst customer service/delivery experience of my life and I think it's fair to say they committed a fair amount of scam/fraud. \n\nI've tried to make this as easy to read as possible because I can't believe this and hate this company so much and want to save everybody from their evil: \n\nSNEAKY CHARGES: Firstly, everyone should know they charge you immediately for even viewing the cart. It's VERY sneaky &amp; I have never experienced that before on a site. $150 is charged immediately to my card. But, okay fine, whatever - let's put that aside; I did give them my CC info after all. \n\nLATE DELIVERY, NO NOTIFICATIONS: My box was supposed to come on a Monday. Great, I made arrangements to make sure my schedule would work for that. I didn't receive any updates or notifications.....Monday night rolls around, and nothing. Shipping label says not created. ???? \n\nNO RESPONSE/NO CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER: Okay, they must be having delivery issues. I am a reasonable person. I reach out to customer service - they ONLY do email/text, no phone number. There is no opportunity to talk with someone live. \n\nTOOK OVER 2 DAYS (yes, 2 days) TO GET RESPONSE: Their automated message said \"please bear with us - higher volume than usual - will take 24-48 hours for response\". Yes, 48 hours. I'm pretty frustrated. Keep in mind, again, NO other way to contact them besides this. I'm down $150 with no meals and no one will respond to me. There is literally no way to get in touch besides email or text. \n\nI HAD TO BE PERSISTENT TO EVEN GET A RESPONSE: I'm convinced they wouldn't have even responded past 48 hours if I hadn't have kept reaching out. I give them time to respond. The 48 hour mark is approaching and I have heard NOTHING. Nada. No food, no response, and still $150 drained. $150, unfortunately, is a lot of money for me and I either need it refunded or I need my food for the week. I no longer have grocery money. So I get persistent. I text and email their support constantly. I need a response!!!! After probably my 20th text in a row (again, see: desperate) I get a response. \n\nABSOLUTELY INSANE CUSTOMER SERVICE: The customer service rep acknowledges the delay and apologizes. The rest of the message is a copy-paste nonsense that has nothing to do with me not receiving my order or the lack of communication. \"We packed your delivery specifically for you and how you live! Make sure to refrigerate!\" Um...what? I respond immediately: Where is my order, what's going on on, and I need some sort of refund. The rep says my order will now be 3 days late, possibly more. This is crazy - my week is now halfway over and I have no food and my meal planning is completely shot. I again ask for a refund. Another BS copy/paste response. So I ask again. FINALLY, the rep says.....get ready, are you sitting down?....\n\"As a one-time courtesy, we've issued a $45 refund to your account. Please know I'm always here if you need anything!\" \n.......My followup responses go unanswered. \n\nGOT MY BOX 3 DAYS LATE WITH NO NOTIFICATION: right after this customer service interaction, my box arrives! Yay! It looks like it came from war. Every single thing inside is dented and beat up. Things are melting and gross looking and it was only outside for maybe 20 minutes. But wait!! Are you ready for the best part!!!.......\n\nENTIRE ORDER WAS WRONG: yep! You read that right! The ENTIRE order was wrong! Foods I can't eat, meals I never picked or heard of, ingredients missing, AWESOME!! I'm literally in disbelief looking at it after going through all of this - I thought I would at least have meals. Nope. Okay, I immediately go back to customer service. And I'm not waiting 48 hours. I have no food, am down $105, (they so generously gave me $45!!!) and nobody has helped me. I text them again many times in a row. \n\nSomeone responds 2 hours later:\n\"I've refunded your card $45 as a one-time courtesy\". \nMy followup texts demanding full refund go unanswered.\n\nSUMMARY: As someone who is struggling financially but wanted to treat myself to a nice meal plan to eat healthier and help with my dietary allergies, this was an absolute nightmare. They still owe me the full refund but won't respond. I'm posting this for people like me - or even if you're not! - who think this will make their life easier. It won't, it's not, and somehow they'll still scam you out of money. This was mind-blowingly bad service - actually, I can't even say service - it was a straight up con job. Their customer response strategy is INSANE; no phone number or opportunity to talk with someone live, and 48 hour response times even when you're missing your food. No full refunds, even when absolutely everything is wrong. \nI am a level-headed person (lol even if this doesn't seem like it) who understands delays and mishaps. But this, no communication, no help, no acknowledgment, and being so casual about wronging their customer? I don't understand. \n\nSo please, this is my warning - go with another service instead. Thanks Hungryroot! I can't wait to enjoy my soggy pork loins (I don't eat pork) and 4 bags of broccoli! ",

      "text": "I have been doing Hungryroot for a few months now, and just have been generally underwhelmed by the food. \nWhat I do love is the speed with which I can cook meals but more and more I find myself removing, swapping portions of their meals out, changing sides and just basically grocery shopping on their app. Some of their meats are great, but others have an odd flavor.\nI like the combo of precooked meats and pre portioned and pre cut vegetables. I can put most of these meals together in 15 minutes which is awesome. \nI like the option to get groceries but that isn\u2019t mandatory. \n\nI have done factor in the past, which was fine but again underwhelming, and Gobble, which has by far had the best tasting food but lots of prep work and clean up. \nGreenchef, blue apron, hello fresh, similar to gobble. Just more prep work than I want to do on a weeknight after work. \n \nWondering if there is a similar option maybe with more variety or better tasting meals? I feel like I may just have to go back to cooking from scratch on my own.\n",

      "text": "Hello Fresh - it started out great but then the meat quickly went down hill and the meals got repetitive. They also started charging more for none repetitive items.  \n\nEvery plate - Hello Fresh with terrible packaging and even less variety. These were my least favorite \n\nSun Basket- fresh and delicious new flavors and easy recipes. The portions are smaller but we loved it. Then we had children and we didn\u2019t find things our picky eater would eat. It is still one of our favorites \n\nMarley Spoon - very big portions, we always have left overs and there are a huge selection of dishes. It\u2019s especially great if you like Asian dishes like curry and ramen. They often have a harder to find ingredient that makes it worth it. \n\nDinnerly- less expensive Marley Spoon. They still have a great variety but use a lot more of the same ingredients that are easy and cheaper to find at the grocery store. Dinnerly and Marley Spoon we did the longest\n\nHome Chef- the meals were just ok, the variety was overwhelming at times and the packaging was pretty wasteful. We did this one the shortest amount of time. The meals were boring to us\n\nGobble- tasty but not worth the portion size to dollar ratio. \n\nPurple Carrot- honestly it was good but the recipes were more time consuming and I\u2019m not really vegan. So we only tried one box \n\nMethodology- honestly if it wasn\u2019t so expensive I would eat it everyday day. It\u2019s more of individual food you heat up on the stove but it was so good \n\nSakara- I did the cleanse but really only liked the breakfast options. I did like that the food was fresh and I think delivered two or three times for the week very early in the morning. I can\u2019t say it was worth the price tag. \n\nSilver Spoon- for the most part I enjoyed this but the meals needed a little more seasoning. \n\nGreen Chef- it was better before home chef purchased it. It\u2019s easier to prepare than home chef but it contains a lot of recipes that contain nuts which was a problem for us. \n\nBlue Apron - this was the best middle of the road meal kit for us. You can get fancy meals that were also easy to make kid friendly. The options to upgrade the type of meat were also wonderful. We used this service for a year and it was truly enjoyable. There was also a ton of options every week. There a little more prep than some meals but they were all good. \n\nEvery table- it\u2019s not available everywhere but it was inexpensive and we loved the business model of making healthy food available in underserved areas by charging different pricing in different areas and that our money was also helping those who were food insecure. Some meals were better than others but the portions sizes were nice \n\nDaily Harvest- I hated the meals. The smoothies were good but the meals all got tossed after trying them. \n\nRevive superfoods- we ordered these smoothies for a while and really enjoyed them. They were also less expensive than daily harvest. \n\nHungry root- we have tried this twice. The first time they had mostly hungry root branded foods and Banza noodles.  We really did enjoy how quick and easy the food was to make. The pasta sauces and green chili sauces were great as well. We stopped ordering during the pandemic because we were having trouble getting the boxes.  We recently tried it again and there were so many more options the food was fresh and the sauces were still very good. It\u2019s a nice spot between Gobble\u2019s and more intensive meal services.  It\u2019s not a service for people that want interesting flavors but more for people that need to be able to eat quick and healthy food and snacks but don\u2019t want to think about how to meal plan it or what the ingredients are. \n\n\nYou can ask me about any service and I\u2019ll do my best to answer.  I didn\u2019t realize how many I actually tried until I started writing this.  ",

      "text": "UPDATE: I just received another email saying they are refunding my order as \u201cone-time courtesy\u201d. Phew! I don\u2019t know if posting here and on their Facebook page did the trick but I\u2019m glad this is resolved. My warning still stands though\u2014this was a lot of work!\n\nOn January 12 I signed up for HungryRoot, optimistic that there would be meal options that fit my many dietary restrictions. The only way to be sure was to pay first so I did. It turned out there were only 2 meals that actually fit all my requirements (low sodium, low saturated fat, no chocolate, no garlic, onions, spicy/peppers) and they were so basic that I can make the same thing myself for half the cost (plain chicken breast, veggies, potatoes). \n\nI was surprised that after signing up I only had until Monday at 4PM, about 24 hours, before the cart would be finalized so I immediately deleted everything in my cart and sent a cancellation request. This was on January 12, a Sunday. I sent a text and did a support chat and a Contact Us chat (all to ZenDesk I guess) requesting cancellation. I was told I\u2019d get a response from customer service but it might take 72 hours. \n\nOn January 15 I still hadn\u2019t heard anything and checked my hungryroot account\u2014it showed I\u2019d been charged and a cart full of random junk I can\u2019t eat had been ordered. I contacted my bank and filed a credit card dispute. \n\n On the morning of January 16 I finally got a response asking for account info since I\u2019d used ApplePay and my email address was hidden. I immediately sent full account and order info. I got a reply an hour later fsaying sorry, the order had been finalized before I cancelled and that orders are finalized at 4 pm PT on the Monday or Thursday before the upcoming delivery.  \n\nI wrote back \u201cI  HAVE EMAIL DOCUMENTATION THAT I CANCELLED ON JANUARY 12, THE SAME DAY I SIGNED UP, IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING THAT THERE WERE ONLY 2 MEALS THAT MET MY DIETARY RESTRICTIONS. IT\u2019S NOT MY FAULT THAT YOUR SYSTEM IS BEHIND AND DIDN\u2019T RESPOND FOR 3 DAYS.\u201d  No response yet. \n\nHopefully my credit card company will make the conditional refund permanent. If they actually deliver, I\u2019ll be donating most of it since I can only eat 2 of the 20 items they ordered for me. ",

      "text": "I already wrote a review on my shopping/delivery experience with HungryRoot; this is just a review of my first meal re: taste, ease of preparation etc. Check out my previous review on my post history if you want to read the full scoop!\n\nWe had our first meal last night and it was incredible! The QUALITY of the food was so noticeable compared to food from Walmart. This particular recipe was the most bland meal out of everything we got: just unseasoned chicken breast, sweet baby broccoli, and mini potatoes.\n\nThe chicken was perfectly cut so it didn't dry out in the pan, and it wasn't too thick, so the sauce that I made (from ingredients in my pantry) distributed evenly and the chicken didn\u2019t get rubbery. The sweet baby broccoli was so high quality and delicious (although my husband didn't like his too much because I didn't season it well enough; I'll have to work on that), and the potatoes were so easy to make! I just popped the whole bag in the microwave per the instructions, but there wasn\u2019t anything special about them lol. I made the sauce for the chicken from olive oil, stone ground mustard, and honey. For the sweet baby broccoli, I didn't cook them per the instructions, because I prefer saut\u00e9ed or roasted vegetables to steamed. So I pan fried them in olive oil and lemon juice and let them get a bit of a char before I added about a 1/4 cup of water and covered them to steam for a few minutes. But seriously, it was so easy and so tasty!!\n\nI feel like this is perfect for me because I DO still like to get creative in the kitchen, but the ingredients from this service created such a better foundation than the low-quality ingredients from Walmart AND there's barely any prep because everything is pre washed and precut so it cuts the time in the kitchen in half. \n\nIt also takes all the guesswork out of meal planning; you just pick your meals (or not!) for the week and all you have to do is decide which day you want each meal on. I was spending hours every week searching for recipes, creating a meal plan, making a grocery list, and then actually shopping \ud83d\ude29. What a freaking pain. But with HungryRoot, there\u2019s no reading through every recipe and going to your pantry to see if you have the ingredients, all of the ingredients come to you as you need them each week! Yes, I still need to make a meal plan because I can\u2019t trust the sodium filter (so I can\u2019t just let the app pick for me), but now making a plan is super fun! I enjoy mixing and matching and using my points wisely; it\u2019s kinda like a little puzzle every week, only with the prospect of delicious food! And I DO still kind of shop, but I do it sitting down in my living room lol.\n\nThe portion sizes are moderate; I would not call them generous, but I also wouldn\u2019t call them small by any means. My husband and I ate every single bit of the chicken and sweet baby broccoli, but we did have four mini potatoes left over. We were definitely full after our meal, so my final ruling on the portion size is that it was almost perfect lol. Here\u2019s to no more waste! No more rotting vegetables in the crisper, no more forgotten leftovers in the fridge. Just exactly what my husband and I need; no more, no less.\n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with our first meal. I very highly doubt I would be AS satisfied if I didn\u2019t know how to cook and I didn\u2019t doctor it up myself, but if you are someone in that position, you should just choose one of the MANY meals that have sauces and seasonings included. All of the other recipes I ordered have these included; like tonight we\u2019re having Yuzu salmon and asparagus, and the \u2019Yuzu\u2019 part is a premade sauce. I think I\u2019ll make some brown rice to go with it just in case, because my husband likes a meat, veggie, AND a carb with his meals. But brown rice is like a dollar per lb so I\u2019m not upset about it, and I have a rice maker so it\u2019ll be easy lol. I\u2019m going to post a new comment in this thread, reviewing each meal for this week, so you guys can have an idea of how the meals with seasonings and sauces taste as well (and maybe get some ideas about how to get creative, too!)!\n\nSo far, I do think that having a stocked pantry is important for using this service, and a basic knowledge of cooking would also be helpful to have for this service as well, because the cooking methods that the recipes suggest are not always my favorite (like who eats steamed vegetables anymore lol). But if you\u2019re like me and you aren\u2019t afraid to be adventurous, this might just be absolutely perfect for you, too!!\n\nIf you want to hear about all of my meals each week, I\u2019ll be posting a new review every day in the comments of this thread. Stay tuned!",

      "title": "I just got my first HungryRoot delivery\u2026 A comprehensive review",
      "text": "Okay so I just got it so I don\u2019t know what it tastes like, but tbh, the diet restrictions that my husband has are really strict and low sodium so everything I got will probably be bland regardless haha.\n\nSo my husband got diagnosed with end stage liver cirrhosis. It\u2019s been a very scary few months. Like I said, his diet is ridiculously strict if he wants to live. He must have less than 2 grams of sodium per day, low fat, no saturated fats, no dairy, no processed meats, high protein, only whole grains, and low sugar \ud83d\ude29\n\nTrying to find recipes that matched ALL of these restrictions was a NIGHTMARE. I did it, but there are so few recipes. I scoured the internet night after night for hours trying to find these damn recipes, and I wanted to rip my hair out.\n\nBecause my husband\u2019s condition is so severe, my mother in law was desperate to help. Unfortunately she lives across the country, so there\u2019s not much she could do. But then, like an angel, she suggested paying for a meal kit service. I was absolutely floored and grateful, but I didn\u2019t know where to start.\n\nI told my bestie about it that night, and she suggested HungryRoot. I\u2019d never heard of it, but from what she described, it sounded like it was a service that could potentially meet our needs (even if we had to make slight modifications).\n\nSo I visited the website and took their quiz to get started. I was so surprised that every single one of my husband\u2019s dietary requirements were listed on the questionnaire. I got super excited to see the options that they offered\u2026 maybe they had a bigger selection than what I could find online? Oh man, I hoped so.\n\nThe end of the quiz came and I was so excited to see what kind of meals were available to us, but these mfers wanted payment FIRST. I just spent like a half hour doing this stupid quiz and, after bitching about it a little bit, I decided to take the risk and go for it. My first order only cost $79 for 6 dinners (12 servings), and they were upfront in disclosing that it would be $113/week after that. I paid, and I was in.\n\nThese guys have HUNDREDS of recipes that fit ALL of our needs. I could only find like 15 online, and here they are with hundreds. They had already built a cart for me. Some of it sounded good, some not , but I had to (more importantly) double check the nutritional content to make sure that the restrictions were adhered to.\n\nEvery single diet restriction was accounted for EXCEPT the sodium. I attempted numerous times to get the sodium filter to work, but it just wouldn\u2019t. I contacted customer support to see what I was doing wrong (via text), but they didn\u2019t get back to me right away, and I wanted to keep shopping. So I just resorted to looking at every nutritional label on each recipe and move on with my life. They did eventually get back to me within about 1/2 hour and requested screenshots of the issue, but I didn\u2019t care anymore because I was already used to looking at the nutritional facts and I just ignored the text lol. Most of the recipes on there were low in sodium anyway; there were some that definitely weren\u2019t though.\n\nSo the whole shopping system is run by points. Your money gets converted into points, and depending on your plan, you get a specific amount of points. So I have the plan that costs $113 and I get 56 points. The dinners range between 6-15 points, with the average cost being about 10ish. If you go over, they\u2019ll charge you more (how much idk), and if you\u2019re under, your points roll over into the next week. You will always be charged the same amount regardless of whether you use all of your points, but you don\u2019t lose them, so that\u2019s a plus!\n\nSo I filled my first cart with six meals totaling exactly 56 points. The recipes looked so stupid easy, all with max five ingredients including condiments and sides. Most of the veggies are precut and washed, the sauces are premade, the potatoes all microwaveable. I had two days to make any changes if I decided to. My first delivery was set to arrive exactly one week from my original purchase.\n\nIn the meantime, I received a text telling me that my next cart was ready (I can\u2019t remember exactly when during the week it was). I went to look at my second cart and got started right away with customization. \n\nI forgot to mention earlier that they give you a free gift with each box. You can choose between a few options; I chose protein. With my first box, they chose two small sirloin steaks for me. On my second one, I got to choose between a few options and I chose beef strips. This is important for my next point.\n\nSo I have a few veggies in my fridge that I need to use, and I also have this free beef I got from them. Guess what? You can even customize recipes (except for those with only two ingredients). So on my second order, I took off a few veggie sides from the meals (which put more points in my bank), and I got a pad Thai veggie kit SEPARATELY to go with the beef strips. Yeah , I forgot to mention that you can choose \u2018groceries\u2019 and choose the ingredients separately! I ended up choosing 5 full meals, the one veggie side to go with the beef strips, and some pomegranate juice that my husband requested. I now have four extra points to spend next week!\n\nI was super worried for my first delivery to come, though. I\u2019d read some pretty negative reviews about the delivery process, but from my understanding, the service you get depends on the area of the country you live and what company they hire to deliver in your area. I live in Tucson, AZ, so I was keeping my fingers crossed that this was a good area. Then delivery day came.\n\nI gotta tell you, I was NOT disappointed! The box came at about 2pm and I got a text when it arrived. I wasn\u2019t going to be home until 9pm, but my husband was home to bring it inside. Poor guy. He could barely get it in the door because he\u2019s so weak from his condition, so I told him not to worry about putting it away and I would do it when I got home, even though I was going to be late. We can deal with a little warm food, I\u2019m sure.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t have to deal with warm food after all! The box was extremely well-insulated. On top of the insulation were the pantry items(spices, breads, etc), then you lifted the insulation, and next came the veggies. After the veggies (separated by a piece of cardboard) were the meats, right next to a freaking huge ice pack on the bottom of the box that was still almost COMPLETELY frozen after hours of being in transit and sitting in our living room. It seriously was beautifully packaged. Every single one of my items were inside, nothing was missing, and everything was freezing cold.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m ridiculously satisfied with my experience. This is my first meal delivery service and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever go back to normal grocery shopping again. I cannot recommend this company enough. It\u2019s a great value, it\u2019s healthy af, it is outrageously accommodating to dietary needs, the recipes are so simple that a five year old could do them, and shopping for meals is SUPER FUN! If you\u2019re looking for a great experience with a meal kit service, a completely customizable menu, and you\u2019re trying to be more health conscious, this is absolutely the service for you. I\u2019ve attached a few photos of my first haul and my most recent cart so you can get an idea of what you\u2019ll experience when you use this service. Overall, 10/10.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

      "text": "We tried HungryRoot for a few months a couple of years ago, and had a negative experience. Too late, I checked their Google Maps listing and found HungryRoot had a 1.8 Star user review rating. Many of the negative reviews echoed our experience: Less than fresh food, deliveries that arrived with the contents at room temperature, and unresponsiveness on the part of HungryRoot customer service.\n\nSometime after we cancelled our subscription, HungryRoot's Google Maps listing disappeared. At the time of this post, searching Google Maps for HungryRoot in the US will yield no results. (There is a \"self catering\" business in India named HungryRoot, apparently unrelated to the meal delivery service in the US).\n\nHow does a business disappear from Google Maps? If a business with a poor Google rating can simply remove themselves from Google Maps, almost all businesses with poor ratings would do so. Google Maps is supposedly reliable because businesses are generally unable to remove bad reviews or their listing, How did HungryRoot manage to do this?",

      "text": "I want to preface this by saying that HungryRoot could be amazing for people who don\u2019t have a lot of time to cook/prep, like their meals planned out for them, and eat an omnivorous diet. That said, I\u2019m primarily plant-based which plays a role in this review. \n\nI\u2019d used HungryRoot in the past (right at the beginning of COVID) and loved it. The meals were great, fresh, and super easy to put together which was mainly what I was looking for in a meal delivery service. \n\nHowever, I recently signed back up and received my first box this past Sunday (Sep 22). Over half of the ingredients have best by dates of Sep 24, so 2 days after I received the box. For meals that are supposed to last all week, this is super annoying. To be fair, I am a stickler for best by/expiration dates, so this may not be an issue for some folks. \n\nAdditionally, the two packs of Brussels sprouts I received were brown and moldy, and I had to toss them. \n\nWhen I went online to skip my next order, I decided to see what the full cost of my next box would be since I got a discount on the first box. The total price would be around $123.48 for the box, which consisted of 6 recipes/12 servings. This breaks down to about $20 per recipe. \n\nNormally, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but the fact that I\u2019m plant-based makes this a huge issue for me. One of the recipes I received consisted of an 8 oz pack of tofu, a pouch of instant rice, some chopped veggies, and curry sauce. Those ingredients absolutely do NOT justify a $20 cost for 2 servings. I could get all of those ingredients for way less than $20. The fact that a black bean and cauliflower taco is one credit less than a rib eye steak with potatoes and broccoli is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nEven some of the \u201chigher\u201d end recipes don\u2019t justify this price point. 2 Beyond Burgers with buns and tzatziki sauce still shouldn\u2019t be $20.\n\n\nOver all, the concept of HungryRoot is great, but they\u2019ve gotta fix the pricing structure and quality control issues.

Delicious meals, but the downside on that one is packaging/delivery. They\u2019re not packed to last if you\u2019re at work, so I had to have them shipped to a friend\u2019s (because they work from home) and pick it up there. Kind of a pain. I\u2019ve tried two others that sent me ingredients to cook (Home Chef and Hungry Root) and I just don\u2019t realistically have time for that. I ended up back with Cook Unity for now, but just realized the meal I\u2019m heating tonight isn\u2019t actually all that great. Some of the top ingredients include high fructose corn syrup and MSG (which I know isn\u2019t terrible, but often unnecessary).

If the box arrives really late, or if an item is busted open or spoiled, just ask and they\u2019ll give a full refund.\n\nA couple tips: it\u2019s best to customize your box every week - do not count on their automatic cart builder to send the most satisfying meals. It takes 5 mins tops to customize, faster than driving to the store. Also, yes, the calorie counts are not always going to be spot on. Often they send more than 2 portions of an ingredient (like sauce or veggies), and sometimes we end up using all of it for the meal rather than saving for later. If you want an exactly correct calorie count, you need pay attention to the serving size on individual packages and how much oil, etc you are using. \n\nAlso folks, if you want food in general to taste yummy, fancy it up a little! You\u2019re gonna need to own and use more seasonings than just salt+pepper.  I add garlic powder and everything bagel seasoning to most of the veggies. Soy sauce and lemon juice are also great to have on hand. I always have BBQ sauce and have learned to make protein ranch with Greek yogurt. ",

If you can't fix the small problems, I don't trust you will be able to resolve bigger problems.

      "text": "I've been pretty happy with hungryroot for 2 years so I came on the sub to see how many others have posted about how it's improved their diet and nutrition , as well as optimizing time spent with planning and execution. Well to my surprise it seems everyone else comes here because of the inescapable hell their delivery and/or packaging has turned out to be. Can't imagine. My heart goes out to y'all and I hope hungryroot gets their stuff together so they can have new satisfied customers like me, so we can actually appreciate our meals and swap tips and what not. \n\nMy tip is that you can use meals with certain classes of veggies or sauces for awhile, primarily for me it's arugula and the green chili sauce. So you can be smarter about food waste by planning your meals around the extra ingredients or choosing meals which you know you don't need the full ingredient for the meal. This alone makes it a nice option since there's so many recipe options and you can easily mix and match with the flexibility of their system, including swaps, deleting items, and simply buying groceries. I sound like a plug probably but realistically I'm just grateful that I found something that worked after years of trying and failing to diet. With the help of semaglutide, chatgpt (for calorie and macro estimating) and hungryroot I've lost 37 lbs in a year and at my goal weight. As a 4'11 woman, getting enough nutrition at rediculously low calories was a challenge but I enjoy the ample amount of protein, healthy fat, and complex carbs I'm able to squeeze out of these recipes. I appreciate the thought that went into the recipes, and in my case my packagers and deliverers who get my box to me perfectly 95% of the time. \n\nHungryroot is standout and it's a shame it's customers aren't satisfied, but hopefully this can change :) ",

      "text": "[RANT]\n\nSo I tried Hello Fresh last year because someone sent me a really great promo.  I very much practice reducing how much waste I produce - as much as I can with my disabilities. It was very upsetting to see how much excessive plastic useage there was, so I cancelled my Hello Fresh after that first order.\n\nFast forward a year later and my disabilities have gotten much worse and therefore I\u2019m far less capable of helping my husband with groceries, cooking, and keeping up with expiring food. We've wasted so much food over the year because of his busy schedule and my diminishing ability to help stay on top of things. \n\nSo I did some research and found that overall, mealkits produce less waste. I looked into the options that have been tested by outside groups to calculate the wastage by these companies and the consumers. Every plate was among the best, and it was the most affordable. So when I got my box in today I was surprised to see less waste (so far) but as I unloaded I found that every carrot and zucchini were in individual bags that were WAY too big. And low and behold the packaging said \"Hello Fresh\". A quick Google search and I found out that EveryPlate is Hello Fresh's cheaper alternative.  I feel douped. \n\nAnyone else bothered by the unnecessary plastic? I get that overall there's less of an impact, but that doesn't mean they shouldn\u2019t bother reducing excessive plastic. I mean, a single produce bag could hold a whole bundle alone. Why send me 10 carrots in separate bags??\n\nLast year I got in touch with Hello Fresh and expressed my concerns. Instead of a response regarding the issue they tried keeping me from unsubscribing. I\u2019ll be contacting EveryPlate too, but I expect it\u2019ll go unnoticed.",

I'm seeing that many of them contain a lot of the same ingredients - roma tomatoes, onion, sour cream, lemon/lime seem the be the big ones that I use almost every time. Seems to be a lot of overlap between recipes.\n\nI'm wondering if it would be possible to create a spreadsheet where I can filter by the ingredients I have, and it shows me what recipes I could make with those ingredients. I've tried to do some searching on my own as to not recreate the wheel, but I can't find one that specifically is what I'm looking for. I'm happy to do the leg work in compiling all the ingredients/recipes if someone smarter than me can create the spreadsheet lol. Also happy to share once it's done. Even 5$ via venmo if someone can help me!!! I'm desperate lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks friends. Love seeing your creations.",

      "text": "I\u2019m convinced EveryPlate\u2019s recipe team is either trolling us or has sworn a blood oath to destroy the concept of taste. Over the last few boxes, about 90% of the meals have been bland, tasteless, or so offensively bad they feel like a dare. And before anyone says \u201cmaybe you cooked it wrong\u201d \u2014 no. I\u2019ve been cooking for years, I followed their instructions exactly, and these were disasters before they even hit the pan.\n\nThe latest crime against cuisine? The All-American Cheeseburger. And wow. If this is \u201cAll-American,\u201d then I finally understand why America thinks spray cheese is a food group. The patty was so dry it could have been used as a coaster. The bun? A limp, sad sponge that looked like it had given up on life. McDonald\u2019s or Hungry Jack\u2019s makes better burgers at 3 a.m. during a staff shortage \u2014 and they\u2019re not pretending to be gourmet. At least fast food doesn\u2019t gaslight you into thinking it\u2019s going to be good.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that one. We\u2019ve had \u201czesty\u201d dishes that tasted like plain pasta rinsed in tap water. \u201cFlavour-packed\u201d meals where the only thing packed was the box it came in. \u201cJuicy\u201d cuts of meat that were doomed the second they left the factory. The recipes are so underseasoned it\u2019s like they\u2019re afraid of flavour entirely. It doesn\u2019t matter how well you cook it \u2014 when the ingredients are this uninspired, the result is always disappointing.\n\nThe recipe approval process must go something like this:\n\n1. Write a name that sounds delicious.\n2. Throw darts at a wall covered in random ingredients.\n3. Ship it out and hope the customer\u2019s taste buds have gone on holiday.\n\nI didn\u2019t sign up for a dinner subscription to be served \u201csad beige food for sad beige people.\u201d I wanted meals I could look forward to, not ones I have to psych myself up to eat.\n\nThe saddest part? The descriptions on the cards. They\u2019re like dating profiles for food: \u201cFull of flavour!\u201d \u201cA real crowd-pleaser!\u201d Then you meet them in real life and realise they lied about everything. EveryPlate is catfishing my taste buds.\n\nSo here\u2019s my plea: please, for the love of all things edible, taste your own meals before you send them out. Because right now, the only thing you\u2019re consistently delivering is comedy \u2014 and not the good kind.",

And even though I cooked the potatoes for over 20 minutes longer than the recommended time, they still came out underdone. I wonder what I could have done better? The sandwich tasted great though, 10/10. Next time I'll just parboil the potatoes to be sure they'll cook through when roasted.",

I like cooking and making the food myself so readymade meals are not for me. The biggest factor for me is cost. I was able to keep my hellofresh subscription around $65-75 a week for 2 meals (4 servings) with the student discount. Unfortunately my discount ran out and the quality overall has been downhill for a while. \n \nI\u2019d like to avoid all of the companies under the HelloFresh umbrella (ie: greenchef, everyplate, chef\u2019s plate, factor) \n \n \nSo far I have gathered that Blue Apron and Marleyspoon are the top choices people recommend. I\u2019d appreciate honest feedback and experiences with both companies and any other similar services. And while I understand that meal kits will inevitably cost more than grocery shopping and making meals on my own, I often pay the ADHD tax when I purchase my own groceries and benefit from a subscription that helps me plan ahead.

      "text": "Hello Fresh - it started out great but then the meat quickly went down hill and the meals got repetitive. They also started charging more for none repetitive items.  \n\nEvery plate - Hello Fresh with terrible packaging and even less variety. These were my least favorite \n\nSun Basket- fresh and delicious new flavors and easy recipes. The portions are smaller but we loved it. Then we had children and we didn\u2019t find things our picky eater would eat. It is still one of our favorites \n\nMarley Spoon - very big portions, we always have left overs and there are a huge selection of dishes. It\u2019s especially great if you like Asian dishes like curry and ramen. They often have a harder to find ingredient that makes it worth it. \n\nDinnerly- less expensive Marley Spoon. They still have a great variety but use a lot more of the same ingredients that are easy and cheaper to find at the grocery store. Dinnerly and Marley Spoon we did the longest\n\nHome Chef- the meals were just ok, the variety was overwhelming at times and the packaging was pretty wasteful. We did this one the shortest amount of time. The meals were boring to us\n\nGobble- tasty but not worth the portion size to dollar ratio. \n\nPurple Carrot- honestly it was good but the recipes were more time consuming and I\u2019m not really vegan. So we only tried one box \n\nMethodology- honestly if it wasn\u2019t so expensive I would eat it everyday day. It\u2019s more of individual food you heat up on the stove but it was so good \n\nSakara- I did the cleanse but really only liked the breakfast options. I did like that the food was fresh and I think delivered two or three times for the week very early in the morning. I can\u2019t say it was worth the price tag. \n\nSilver Spoon- for the most part I enjoyed this but the meals needed a little more seasoning. \n\nGreen Chef- it was better before home chef purchased it. It\u2019s easier to prepare than home chef but it contains a lot of recipes that contain nuts which was a problem for us. \n\nBlue Apron - this was the best middle of the road meal kit for us. You can get fancy meals that were also easy to make kid friendly. The options to upgrade the type of meat were also wonderful. We used this service for a year and it was truly enjoyable. There was also a ton of options every week. There a little more prep than some meals but they were all good. \n\nEvery table- it\u2019s not available everywhere but it was inexpensive and we loved the business model of making healthy food available in underserved areas by charging different pricing in different areas and that our money was also helping those who were food insecure. Some meals were better than others but the portions sizes were nice \n\nDaily Harvest- I hated the meals. The smoothies were good but the meals all got tossed after trying them. \n\nRevive superfoods- we ordered these smoothies for a while and really enjoyed them. They were also less expensive than daily harvest. \n\nHungry root- we have tried this twice. The first time they had mostly hungry root branded foods and Banza noodles.  We really did enjoy how quick and easy the food was to make. The pasta sauces and green chili sauces were great as well. We stopped ordering during the pandemic because we were having trouble getting the boxes.  We recently tried it again and there were so many more options the food was fresh and the sauces were still very good. It\u2019s a nice spot between Gobble\u2019s and more intensive meal services.  It\u2019s not a service for people that want interesting flavors but more for people that need to be able to eat quick and healthy food and snacks but don\u2019t want to think about how to meal plan it or what the ingredients are. \n\n\nYou can ask me about any service and I\u2019ll do my best to answer.  I didn\u2019t realize how many I actually tried until I started writing this.  ",

They had a few items that could be upgraded but we had a balance of fish and red meat for the first three deliveries. We don't eat pork and about a month later there were an abundance of pork menus but very little red meat. Fish recipes are redundant. Vegetarian options were pasta with tomato sauce and I can do that myself. Then, as a supposedly organic service we began getting notifications that they couldn't supply organic. \n\nSuddenly, at one month as soon as the promo was complete, there were no longer red meat options, except to pay $10 per serving. The servings have been tiny and we already eat small portions! We had to supplement veggies and proteins because we were still hungry at the end of the meal. (We are both 5'3' tall and 115 pounds and small bodied, not that should  make a difference from feeling satisfied from the first to boxes to the last three.)\n\nI decided to try it one more time and today I opened each bag that had half as much as it once did. The veggie portions are just under half a cup! for two people!!! The point of this was to free up grocery store time and with heavy work schedules, not have to think about meals or prep. \n\nYes, a convenience in a world falling apart with people starving. We could do this and we paid for it. An agreement with Green Chef seems to be, we will get you in then slowly charge you more and give you next to nothing. American way of screwing the consumer and walking away with the money. \n\nPros: first three weeks were great, delicious, walked away satisfied, grateful to have creativity time in other areas. \n\nCONS: not always organic, small portions, no red meat options without tripling the price, redundant menu options, vegetarian is boring and small. \n\nPoor business practices.

The instructions say to rub some oil onto the pitas and bake them for 5 minutes, which I have done in the past and it usually led to them becoming very crispy but also way too stiff and brittle to open afterwards. This time I baked the pitas very briefly (basically just 1-2 minutes to warm them up) and they were nice and flexible, but it was still completely impossible to open them without major tears everywhere on the thinner side. In fact, there were already a bunch of small cracks and tears on there when they arrived, and as far as I remember that was the same when I got them from HF before.\n\nAm I missing something or has anyone some tips for pita-prepping? I had some store-bought pitas before that were a bit smaller and much thicker than the HF/GC ones, and easy to open once warm (you could even put them in the toaster). However, all the ones I receive through meal kits end up as some kind of dipping bread because they just don't work as a fillable pocket. I don't mind that in some cases, but for this recipe it really made the meal awkward to eat.",

Two boxes showed up a day or two late but the food was still cold so no issue. The other issue was that sometimes the recipe card(s) werent in the box, but we just used the app, so again NBD. \n\nThe main reason we left HF was because my nurses discount ran out after a year. So we decided to use another food delivery service with another discount for the time being. We chose Greenchef.\n\nMy first couple of opinions on Greenchef (GC). Our first box comes this coming week.\n\u2022 I'm a little disappointed in the price. I read online from an article that this was the cheapest price per meal. HF cost us $61.84 for 3 meals/2 people with the discount. GC will cost $78.14 with the discount for 3 meals/2 people. I read on an article recently that GC was the cheapest price per meal.\n\u2022 GC app is exactly the same set up as HF \n\u2022 GC food looks healthier, just from a picture stand point. My boyfriend is a meat and potatos kind of guy so we had a little bit of a harder time agreeing on what to get. \n\u2022 Most of the meal times are 30 mins and under, whereas I felt HF was more 45-50 mins and under mostly. \n\u2022 There was a few meals that were the same! We expected this since GC is owned by HF. \n\nSo long as I'm a nurse we will probably continue to use food delivery services similar to GC or HF. I've heard that the longer you stay away from HF the discounts get larger. \n\nIf there are any questions feel free to ask! ",

But the rave reviews puzzle me &amp; here\u2019s why- the fish &amp; steaks have a soggy texture upon arrival. It\u2019s truly awful- the steaks have the texture of wet, crumpled paper towels. The gulf shrimp &amp; ground lamb are tasteless. Chicken is probably the most palatable of the proteins. They also give you 10 ounces of chicken per serving while Green Chef does 12 oz- it does make a difference. Sometimes the meals are just bland, lack color variety (indicates antioxidants) or reflect low effort on the part of SB. Most dishes are too low calorie for us, we are not big people but find ourselves hungry soon after the meal, even when we add sides. And now I know one reason why!! Sunbasket inflates the calorie count. So for example tonight we had a serving of 6 scallops. That\u2019s 100 calories. Butter adds 50 at most. Then a serving of pearl couscous which is around 200 calories. A fris\u00e9e salad with it, which is hardly worth counting. If you do the math = 400 calories or so. But the recipe card says this is 680 calories!! Noo effin\u2019 way. This has happened a couple times that I actually know of for a fact (I just started paying attention). These guys cut corners like nobody\u2019s business, so if you\u2019re health conscious watch out bc you\u2019re probably not getting the nutrients advertised. As for the taste, it\u2019s hit or miss. We had a good run in the beginning but have had too many fails lately to say we like the service. But denying your customers basic nutrition is just inexcusable. Not surprising if it\u2019s true there was a lawsuit against them in the past over misrepresenting ingredients as organic. ",

Anyway, here's our situation. We're a family of 3, me wife and 8 yr old boy. Life gets pretty busy for us between my owning and operating a small business, her having the home to take care of, a part time job, and pretty substantial ADHD. That being said, we can afford groceries just fine, but we live an hour away from any supermarket, and groceries in our little town are god awfully expensive. So when we do shop, it's $400+ and a good portion of it goes to waste.\n\nThe waste is in part due to her ADHD. She'll forget what we have or let stuff get buried in the back of the fridge, or just go wild cooking and cook too much. I love left overs and grew up in a home where we basically fought over them, not out of poorness, but for love of mama's cooking. Some times she just cooks that much.\n\nI know the simplest answers would be\n\n\"keep better track of what you're buying\"\n\n\"Try a written out meal prep plan\"\n\n\"Just don't cook too much\"\n\nRespectfully, I know! But it's just not working out for us. So, what are your recommendations on a decent meal kit or food delivery service? We make pretty good money, so it doesn't have to be the cheapest option, but the whole point is to spend less in the big picture, so not the best of the best. We do eat with general health in mind, but aren't strict dieters. Ideally, we prefer to eat minimal processed foods, minimal food dyes and such, but aren't afraid of bacon and butter (In moderation of course and typically not together)\n\nCheers and thank you all",

      "text": "After using mealkits like HF and Marley Spoon for a while, I've been looking into pre-cooked options like Factor and Tempo recently, but I'm pretty irritated how small the portions appear to be. I know that they're all advertising to be somewhat health-conscious, but even GreenChef manages to provide a meal with lots of protein and veggies that hits the 800-1000 calorie range. \n\nEven though the Factor and Tempo have dedicated \"&lt;500kcal\" categories, these are basically meaningless because virtually none of their meals are above 600kcal. That's somewhat reasonable for a quick lunch, but they also advertise this as an option for both lunch and dinner and specifically try to sell you huge quantities of meals (way more than services like HF let you select) at once. As a somewhat active man, two 500-600kcal meals a day are way too little, meaning that I'll either have to eat out, add in lots of snacks, or have multiple of their expensive meals at once. To be honest, I simply don't get why they can't add some more carbs or meat at the given price point to make the service attractive for more people, given that packaging/prep/shipping should make up the vast majority of their costs.

Everything is packed in plastic, including thick plastic bottles that are difficult to even get sauce out of.\n\nWhy is Home Chef even still in business? We have tried Green Chef, which was good but expensive and Marley Spoon, which was also poor choice-wise for pescatarians but the ingredients were fine.\n\nI do wish Hello Fresh would include better quality ingredients sometimes.

Not to mention I was charged full price ($115) for this latest box even though I'm supposed to be getting a percentage off for the next couple boxes.\n\nThis seems like a super shady business practice. The hidden 2nd subscription that I can't control combined with the weird \"accidental\" hangups 2x from their customer service, I have a lot of doubt about the legitimacy of this company. If you're considering signing up with them, run don't walk.",

No salmon meal, and instead two meals that I never would have picked (one with pork chops, which my husband doesn't eat, and one that heavily features mushrooms, which I despise). \n\nDo I have any recourse here? I can't see the full menu to trigger my memory of the meals I did select. But I know I did not pick these meals, and they were changed without alerting me.

So I head to the FAQ and find this: \n\n\"How long do the ingredients stay fresh inside the box?\nThe ingredients can stay fresh up to 48 hours of being in the box, without being refrigerated.\"\n\nBut I don't know when my ingredients were put inside the box. It's not indicated anywhere on my account. So I call help and ask. They also don't know but they say that the ingredients stay fresh for 48 hours after the delivery time. \n\nUmmm.... that's absolutely not what the FAQ says, so I read it back to her. She says I'm reading it wrong and that it doesn't mean 48 hours from when the food goes in the box but 48 hours after it gets to your home. (?!) That makes zero sense, especially since there's a 12 hour delivery window! \n\nShe insists that it's 48 hours after estimated delivery time and tells me to call back once I get the box. So ... I wait for the box. I will decide when it arrives, I guess.",

No surprise they didn\u2019t come. \n\nI sent a message thru the website and they offered to refund my shipping and credit my acct for the remainder (~$120). Eventually they agreed to refund the entire thing to my credit card after I complained. Only they didn\u2019t. They refunded the $113 I paid for the meals, and none of the shipping or upgrade charges I made. Guess they kept the rest for their troubles.",

Got signed up with MS and SB. \n\nSo far, I love the all protein choices with SunBasket, but the meals feel a little light on amounts. I usually have to add sides. The items seem as fresh as HF. Two produce items had a live snail and they gave me a credit of $5. And many people have said they have more bugs etc bc of the organic element- so note that! Their \u201cfresh and ready\u201d meals are delicious! And you just microwave or oven for 10 minutes. Lots of \u201cextras\u201d to choose from, you could almost grocery shop through them, but pricey! \n\nMarley Spoon has been a nightmare. Which is too bad because I love their recipe options. If they had reliable service, I could see going with just them. Here\u2019s what happened. \n1. First box. Meat open and spoiled. No biggie. It happens. What stunk was an email AND a phone after that email was never replied to after a week- to get a credit of $12. For four steaks? Seems wrong. Also, one of the meals didn\u2019t have enough of the ingredients and they were all\nmeasured incorrectly. That was annoying but not a huge deal. \n2. Second box. No show today. FedEx says label created. It never ready for shipping. Call to MS and their rep says they will email me in 30min with more information. 8hrs later. No box. No update. No email. \n\nSo, I\u2019m probably going to give them one more week or cancel. \n\nThis to say, while Hello Fresh can have its hiccups, it is consistent and reliable. That\u2019s actually part of the reason I started skipping- a little too reliable (scallions and lime, amiright?). But I will take redundant over ridiculous any day. I don\u2019t t need this stress from Marley Box for something I pay so much for. \n\nDon\u2019t go seeking elsewhere if you\u2019re happy with Hello Fresh. Maybe take a week off every now and then - but definitely stay away from Marley Spoon. I\u2019m going to predict they won\u2019t make it much longer at this rate. Just awful.",

But the rave reviews puzzle me &amp; here\u2019s why- the fish &amp; steaks have a soggy texture upon arrival. It\u2019s truly awful- the steaks have the texture of wet, crumpled paper towels. The gulf shrimp &amp; ground lamb are tasteless. Chicken is probably the most palatable of the proteins. They also give you 10 ounces of chicken per serving while Green Chef does 12 oz- it does make a difference. Sometimes the meals are just bland, lack color variety (indicates antioxidants) or reflect low effort on the part of SB. Most dishes are too low calorie for us, we are not big people but find ourselves hungry soon after the meal, even when we add sides. And now I know one reason why!! Sunbasket inflates the calorie count. So for example tonight we had a serving of 6 scallops. That\u2019s 100 calories. Butter adds 50 at most. Then a serving of pearl couscous which is around 200 calories. A fris\u00e9e salad with it, which is hardly worth counting. If you do the math = 400 calories or so. But the recipe card says this is 680 calories!! Noo effin\u2019 way. This has happened a couple times that I actually know of for a fact (I just started paying attention). These guys cut corners like nobody\u2019s business, so if you\u2019re health conscious watch out bc you\u2019re probably not getting the nutrients advertised. As for the taste, it\u2019s hit or miss. We had a good run in the beginning but have had too many fails lately to say we like the service. But denying your customers basic nutrition is just inexcusable. Not surprising if it\u2019s true there was a lawsuit against them in the past over misrepresenting ingredients as organic. ",

Initially a food runner, I made the transition to Quality Assurance and found myself very comfortable there. I was the only QA guy in my part of the building (it was a two-man job) and, while not a model employee, the numbers showed significant improvement on account of my efforts. \nI was generally well-liked until one day when I came in to a lot of sideways glances and whispers. It wasn\u2019t too long before the harassment started and I was beside myself. Upon walking into the facility, I would instead be greeted with calls of \u201cfaggot\u201d and \u201cwhore\u2026\u201d all sorts of other slurs and in multiple languages. Unsure how they found out and not really giving two thirds a half-eaten rat\u2019s ass what anyone thought, I continued to do my job while ignoring the bigotry that rose up around me.\nIt got worse and worse. I spoke with HR. The first time didn\u2019t go so well - she did more to discourage me than anything. Then she was replaced and I tried again with much better results. Jackie had my back, or seemed to, and eventually, the idiocy quieted down and I was able to continue Qing A. \nAnd then it picked back up and quickly became a much worse situation than it had been prior. I had to tell Jackie that I didn\u2019t feel safe there because it was literally EVERYBODY harassing me - everywhere I went regardless of the fact that most of these people didn\u2019t even know me. \nShe sent me home that day, with pay, until she could figure out how to proceed with the situation. \nTwo weeks later, I get a letter via FedEx - I\u2019d been fired. No reason given. \nInstead of handling the situation, she apparently figured it would be easiest just to fire me and carry on as if nothing had happened. I trusted SunBasket. I trusted HR, knowing that if I took my problem to her, she would sort it out the right way because that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s supposed to do. All the sexual harassment training we went through, the zero-tolerance for harassment policy they talked about all the time - I knew everything was going to be ok in time. Instead, I was lied to and betrayed by a fraud. \nI did my job. Results spoke for themselves. SunBasket\u2019s HR MANAGER failed to do hers, the result was betrayal of the core concept of her role and what she went to school for and yet she still gets a paycheck. \nPrior to being fired, I reached out to the CEO, Adam Zbar, to tell him that something was very wrong at the east coast facility and asking to speak with him about it. I never got a reply. \nYeah, I\u2019m disgruntled - wouldn\u2019t you be? But I swear that every word of this post is true. Knowing the truth won\u2019t make your food taste and better or worse.  Regardless, I\u2019d like you to think about what you\u2019re supporting with every purchase of a meal kit. \n ",

      "text": "I joined Sunbasket originally back in 2021 and really enjoyed their food. I never had trouble finding meals because they had many vegetarian options, it was great. I stopped getting them primarily for financial reasons.\n\nI just restarted because I'm considering meal kits again, and I wanted to see the menu. I verified when restarting that my preferences were still set to vegetarian, with no beef, pork, poultry, shellfish, lamb, etc etc. I took a look at the menu for the week and thought wow, where did all the vegetarian dishes go? I figured I'd come back and look later. Of course I forgot, and just got billed today for a box. I went to look and it's mostly meat options. 2x vegetarian meals, 8x meat meals.\n\nSo I immediately hopped on chat and said \"Hey, why did you send me meat, when the dietary preferences said I was vegetarian?\" They said well, you have to pick your menus manually, or we'll just send you whatever, we ignore the dietary preferences. Why even _have_ a \"vegetarian\" box to tick if you're going to send meat if I don't check the choices in time?\n\nThey claim they're going to refund me, and if not I'll do a chargeback. I'm not using Sunbasket ever again - their menus have changed drastically and their policies are ridiculous.\n\nEdit: Refund successful.",

      "text": "Our family of three (45F, 42M, and 11F) have tried a bunch of meal kits lately. Here's my general assessment as a somewhat new customer to the meal kit industry. We get 3x meals for 4 people, and I usually add on a few market extras for convenience. Us girls have average appetites and the man has a good sized appetite; he can easily eat two servings of most of the dishes we have received from all 3 companies. If we have leftovers, it's usually 1 portion or less.\n\nOverall I'm thinking about getting more veg-heavy meals and supplementing with my own proteins from the grocery store. I've been satisfied with the pork and chicken, but the steaks are not my favorite and unfortunately we have a non-seafood eater, which limits some things. I also like to incorporate different cuts that aren't always offered in the kits.\n\nHello Fresh-\n-Taste: 8/10\n-On time deliveries (KC metro area). The local Factor van drops off the box.\n-Decent portion sizes. I top up with extra proteins sometimes.\n-Above average variety; some basic meals, some more gourmet. Nicer meals often come with an upcharge of $24+ per meal for the better ingredients. The value isn't there for me with the upgrades, but the basics are good.\n\n\nMarley Spoon-\n-Taste: 9/10\n-Inconsistent deliveries (two of five total deliveries were 2+ days late. My delivery day was Saturday with FedEx so that was likely part of the problem.)\n-Best portion sizes\n-Best variety in the marketplace. I liked trying some of the new products like crepes and ramen.\n-Worst packaging. I hate how nothing is divided up.\n\nGreenChef-\n-Taste: 10/10\n-On time deliveries (HF company)\n-Smallest portion sizes. I'd give them all my business if the portions were bigger.\n-Best quality ingredients. Organic veg and meat, which is nice. Downer is that this isn't important to me; wish they offered a different price point for conventionally grown produce\n-Best packaging - easy to make 2 servings or 4, promoting flexibility \n-Some veggies are pre-chopped, which I appreciate for saving time\n\nI'd like to try Gobble and maybe Sunbasket next. \n\n",

I'm not sure if it's because we're rural or what but bags seem haphazardly thrown together, items that look \"sealed\" are actually not sealed since they bust out the back. The only solution that was provided was to change shippers, which does not seemed to have happened as the same partner showed up recently after requesting the change.

Whenever I get the shipments I immediately freeze the proteins as we usually don't use them until later in the week. Really really concerning when these arrive bad from the supplier. Meat quality in general is just really suspect to me. We've since cancelled and I've brought this to their attention but nobody at Sunbasket really seemed to care. Should be noted that the CS is always good about a credit or a full refund. Has anyone else had this experience with Sunbasket? Seems like a really promising service with a good variety of healthy offerings that just can't keep the same quality as they once had. ",

HC provides several simpler meal options, give you an idea of a meal's shelf life in order to assist prioritizing which meals to make first, provide single-use baking trays, but use a lot more plastic in packaging.\n\n**Factor\\_** \\- (apparently also owned by HF) tried them for one week. Was not impressed. For the same price as a 3-meal 2-serving shipment, you get three single-serving microwave meals. High quality, sure, and requiring minimal if no prep, but how much would you pay for a microwave meal?\n\n**Marley Spoon** \\- I'm in a trial period, and... so far, I'm a fan! (disclaimer: not an employee nor a paid sponsor) Would never stay on and pay full price, but whenever I get another offer, I'll give them another shot. I like their packaging. They have a cardboard tray with all the meals' ingredients (except the meats) plus a single ice pack, cutting down on packaging. They offer three tiers of meals, a standard selection and premium selection, but also offer a more basic selection at a reduced price, which is different. The meal portions are larger. Even when the meats are still usually 10oz portions, the other ingredients flesh it out more. One meal is two hearty servings, where with HC and HF it felt like either too much if I ate it all or not enough if I divided it into two meals. Only quibble is that both times I've had delivery issues.\n\nWhat other meal services have you used and what has been your reaction?",

I found 3 meals that looked good and chose Monday delivery, but figured Tuesday was more realistic. \n\nMonday came and went without a peep from HF. No problem. On Tuesday morning I got a text from FedEx saying my box was out for delivery. Tuesday turned into Wednesday without a delivery, but Wednesday morning I go the same text. That\u2019s all I got, though. No box was delivered. Today - Thursday - I got the exact same text informing me my meals were out for delivery. No surprise they didn\u2019t come. \n\nI sent a message thru the website and they offered to refund my shipping and credit my acct for the remainder (~$120). Eventually they agreed to refund the entire thing to my credit card after I complained. Only they didn\u2019t. They refunded the $113 I paid for the meals, and none of the shipping or upgrade charges I made. Guess they kept the rest for their troubles.",

Other than that the packaging is identical down to the box, the insulating lining, the ice packs, and being delivered by VeHo. \n\nHelloFresh has better instructions. The \u201cBust Out\u201d section seemed corny but at least it was reasonably accurate (but not completely, it never included a cutting board even though that\u2019s almost always required). Marley Spoon\u2019s analogous \u201cTools\u201d section is much worse. The only thing it listed was a skillet even though later instructions called for a small bowl and a baking sheet.  Also Marley doesn\u2019t tell you up front to preheat the oven, a significant oversight IMO. My wife says Marley\u2019s instructions are more like traditional recipes that hold your hand less.  Bottom line with Marley you better read the whole thing before starting. \n\nMarley had better food quality. It\u2019s only one meal so we\u2019ll see if it holds up but their ingredients and meat are better quality. This is what matters most, the reason we switched was regularly getting bad ingredients from HF.",

      "text": "After being with Hello Fresh for about 4 years, I made the change. Keep in mind, i do 4 servings, 4 times a week so a lot of food.  There were a number of different reasons but the main ones being\u2026\n\n1. The quality of the food delivered has drastically fallen.  Rotten vegetables, chicken that looks horrendous and fatty, etc.  The pork is about the only thing that seems to be ok each and every week and that leads me to my next issue.\n\n2. Pork.  Almost every meal available without a surcharge is a pork based meal.  Now granted, I don\u2019t eat shellfish so that\u2019s not an option but geesh, seems like 60% of our non pork choices come with an extra fee.\n\n3. Meal and menu taste/variety.  Honestly, I\u2019m just tired of the same old meals week after week.  It\u2019s all the same ingredients.  Lime zest, pork, potatoes and broccoli.  You get the occasional Buffalo chicken but who wants to eat that every other week.  \n\nMade the switch to Marley Spoon 3 weeks ago and I have been pleasantly surprised.  Meals with steaks that aren\u2019t an extra fee, very little lime or lime zest, and the variety is amazing. We\u2019ll see how long this lasts but definitely worth the couple extra bucks for fresh vegetables delivered and a great assortment.",

I know that they're all advertising to be somewhat health-conscious, but even GreenChef manages to provide a meal with lots of protein and veggies that hits the 800-1000 calorie range. \n\nEven though the Factor and Tempo have dedicated \"&lt;500kcal\" categories, these are basically meaningless because virtually none of their meals are above 600kcal. That's somewhat reasonable for a quick lunch, but they also advertise this as an option for both lunch and dinner and specifically try to sell you huge quantities of meals (way more than services like HF let you select) at once. As a somewhat active man, two 500-600kcal meals a day are way too little, meaning that I'll either have to eat out, add in lots of snacks, or have multiple of their expensive meals at once. To be honest, I simply don't get why they can't add some more carbs or meat at the given price point to make the service attractive for more people, given that packaging/prep/shipping should make up the vast majority of their costs.

The cucumbers have been arriving looking like they were frozen, completely wet, soft, and unusable. Several of potatoes have been soft and about to go off with little left once all the spots are cut out. Various greens and tomatoes have arrived either already bad or go bad within a day or two of receiving them before we get a chance to use them. \n\nTwo weeks ago the delivery company threw the entire box away because it was \u201cleaking\u201d and then this week the package of marina sauce had exploded on everything in the box.\n\nWhen I complain they give the tiniest refunds that barely cover replacement cost and don\u2019t account for the shipping I paid or the inconvenience of having to go to the store and replace them. They refunded $4 this week for the completely destroyed marinara and 3 onions that weren\u2019t enough for the recipes.

But since the beginning of the year I don\u2019t think there has been a single box which has not been problematic.\n\nFirst they forgot recipe cards for a couple of weeks, and they were providing the worlds smallest onions with recipes (I was actively confused because one onion looked like a shallot - it was misshapen and small).\n\nNow for the second week in a row they have just so royally screwing up I\u2019m actively shocked. This week, for example, I got a Mac and cheese kit and a pasta in tomato sauce dish\u2014but no one remembered to include the pasta for the two pasta dishes.\n\nAnd last week when I complained they threw a couple of discounts at me, this time no one has gotten back to me at all.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m trying to figure out if this is happening to everyone and I should just switch kitting companies or have I just been really unlucky for four weeks and the whole thing will resolve itself?",

      "title": "I\u2019ve tried nearly every meal service. Here are the reviews from what I remember ",
      "text": "Hello Fresh - it started out great but then the meat quickly went down hill and the meals got repetitive. They also started charging more for none repetitive items.  \n\nEvery plate - Hello Fresh with terrible packaging and even less variety. These were my least favorite \n\nSun Basket- fresh and delicious new flavors and easy recipes. The portions are smaller but we loved it. Then we had children and we didn\u2019t find things our picky eater would eat. It is still one of our favorites \n\nMarley Spoon - very big portions, we always have left overs and there are a huge selection of dishes. It\u2019s especially great if you like Asian dishes like curry and ramen. They often have a harder to find ingredient that makes it worth it. \n\nDinnerly- less expensive Marley Spoon. They still have a great variety but use a lot more of the same ingredients that are easy and cheaper to find at the grocery store. Dinnerly and Marley Spoon we did the longest\n\nHome Chef- the meals were just ok, the variety was overwhelming at times and the packaging was pretty wasteful. We did this one the shortest amount of time. The meals were boring to us\n\nGobble- tasty but not worth the portion size to dollar ratio. \n\nPurple Carrot- honestly it was good but the recipes were more time consuming and I\u2019m not really vegan. So we only tried one box \n\nMethodology- honestly if it wasn\u2019t so expensive I would eat it everyday day. It\u2019s more of individual food you heat up on the stove but it was so good \n\nSakara- I did the cleanse but really only liked the breakfast options. I did like that the food was fresh and I think delivered two or three times for the week very early in the morning. I can\u2019t say it was worth the price tag. \n\nSilver Spoon- for the most part I enjoyed this but the meals needed a little more seasoning. \n\nGreen Chef- it was better before home chef purchased it. It\u2019s easier to prepare than home chef but it contains a lot of recipes that contain nuts which was a problem for us. \n\nBlue Apron - this was the best middle of the road meal kit for us. You can get fancy meals that were also easy to make kid friendly. The options to upgrade the type of meat were also wonderful. We used this service for a year and it was truly enjoyable. There was also a ton of options every week. There a little more prep than some meals but they were all good. \n\nEvery table- it\u2019s not available everywhere but it was inexpensive and we loved the business model of making healthy food available in underserved areas by charging different pricing in different areas and that our money was also helping those who were food insecure. Some meals were better than others but the portions sizes were nice \n\nDaily Harvest- I hated the meals. The smoothies were good but the meals all got tossed after trying them. \n\nRevive superfoods- we ordered these smoothies for a while and really enjoyed them. They were also less expensive than daily harvest. \n\nHungry root- we have tried this twice. The first time they had mostly hungry root branded foods and Banza noodles.  We really did enjoy how quick and easy the food was to make. The pasta sauces and green chili sauces were great as well. We stopped ordering during the pandemic because we were having trouble getting the boxes.  We recently tried it again and there were so many more options the food was fresh and the sauces were still very good. It\u2019s a nice spot between Gobble\u2019s and more intensive meal services.  It\u2019s not a service for people that want interesting flavors but more for people that need to be able to eat quick and healthy food and snacks but don\u2019t want to think about how to meal plan it or what the ingredients are. \n\n\nYou can ask me about any service and I\u2019ll do my best to answer.  I didn\u2019t realize how many I actually tried until I started writing this.  ",

The closest I've found was this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF5sOImpENo&amp;t=4m26s) by Matt Reilly which recommended adding chambord to the gastrique. I tried that though and it was sickly sweet (I salvaged it with some orange bitters). \n\nThere are a few other blueberry sauces on the web for duck. For example, [cooking with cocktail rings](https://cookingwithcocktailrings.com/seared-duck-breast-with-blueberry-pan-sauce/) has a pan sauce; as does the [New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6182-roast-duck-with-blueberry-sauce) and [Food52](https://food52.com/recipes/81775-duck-breast-recipe). But these are not gastriques, which I think would work best here. There was a Marley Spoon recipe this week that had a blueberry gastrique and was quite good, but lacked of course liquor.\n\nAlso, I feel like a real sauce should have some demi-glace too, and some other liquor, maybe just cognac.",

      "text": "About half a year or so ago I subscribed to one of those meal-box services (Marley Spoon), which is really convenient for me (saves trips to the store, saves me from coming up with what to eat today) and the quality has been excellent so far. \n\nOne thing about it though is that they use a lot of fresh vegetables and almost every recipe is completely from scratch, which is great because it taste good but it does mean there is a lot of slicing and dicing to be done before each meal. And while I love cooking, cutting all the ingredients can be a bit of a chore, especially on weekdays after a long day at the office. \n\nI was wondering if a good quality mandoline would save me a bit of time here. I've never used one and I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with them. Do they save a lot of time and/or make it less of a chore ? Which one would you advice (I'm leaning toward the Bron Coucke as it seems to be a well-made professional tool).",

Their website requires you to put in your CC Number in order to view the meals and recipes.  I did that and found out quickly that the premade meals wouldn't work because of the high calories and macros.  I immediately deactived my account and moved on to the next company.  Yesterday a box arrived with 6 meal kits.  Of the 6 meals, two have OK calories and macros.  I had no idea that by viewing the website they will preselect your meals and ship it.  Even after deactivating the account.  I'm not looking for a refund, I will donate the meals to a family that can eat them.  Some of the meals are over 900 calories per serving.  I obviously did not read the fine print somewhere and will never give my credit card information for view purposes only.  I just wanted people to be aware that this can happen.  I called customer service and was told there is nothing they can do for the order that was delivered.  They did confirm cancelation.  And they also confirmed they have received many complaints of this issue and are working on it.  So this is a public announcement for anyone thinking of buying meal kits or premade meals.  I did make one of the meals last night and it was great.  I will say the quality of the ingredients is great and the recipes are super easy to make.  I never considered the meal kits that you actually cook, and my experience was positive.  Trying to find the good in a bad situation.",

      "title": "CookUnity over Factor (unsolicited)",
      "text": "Background:  I\u2019m a man in my 30\u2019s from the Midwest U.S (many comments on quality seem to mention location playing a role). I wanted a better lunch experience for days I go into the office, but I get fatigued picking out all the different ingredients to keep it interesting when grocery shopping. Buying lunch each day is expensive and the same frozen meals every day is boring. I\u2019m not a DoorDash/uber eats user, so I am not replacing that cost. If you are, this definitely will save you money. I was looking for healthier, better tasting, more various and relatively affordable options for lunch. Maybe a dinner here and there. I tried these companies starting 1/2025.\n\nI\u2019ve had 24 CookUnity meals and 16 factor meals. I have eaten them fresh as well as from frozen. I\u2019ve tried their premium meals (overall not worth the up charge with either company in my opinion). I\u2019ve cooked them in a microwave, air fryer and oven. Eaten them for lunch and dinner (eating truffled fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken from CookUnity for dinner as I type this out), and just got my first breakfast meal options in my most recent order. \n\nI stick with Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Salmon for proteins. \n\nAll in all, CookUnity is a far better experience. \n\nFactor is not terrible and can be better than or atleast a nice change of pace from grocery store frozen or premade meals. So, definitely place an order, get those discount and some free goodies that only factor offers (little juice shots)\n\nWhat I Like about CookUnity:\nQuality- The quality of food is just better with CookUnity. It\u2019s fresher, better texture, and seems like a meal someone would make at home or\u2026even a restaurant. Factor meals seemed less fresh or maybe poorly sourced, the flavor was all from toppings not marinating, and just basic.\n\nVariety: CookUnity has so many different ingredients they use in various dishes. Their chefs take flavors from all over the world and pair them with sides or veggies that fit the theme. Factor just has like \u201cHey! here\u2019s this protein and this side that we have in the inventory that probably go together\u201d\n\nVeggies/Sides/ Variety (continued): The sides really made a difference. CookUnity has Chopped or whole veggies like broccoli, leafy greens, red onions, asparagus, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower\u2026 they have sides like mashed potatoes, red potatoes, Mac n cheese, noodles, and toppings/ sauces in little containers. If you are looking for healthy, you can avoid this stuff, but I freaking love me some sour cream or a side of Mac n cheese. Factor had pretty much the same game plan every time ; Cauliflower rice as a base for their protein and a side of easily microwaveable veggies like broccoli or green beans. And instead of little sauces or toppings, most meals came with a little \u201cbutter scoop\u201d(like those ones at restaurants that sorta look like ice cream\u2026 yes\u2026 I did that once also) of a topping that would melt and disperse over the food as it heated. It usually just soaks into the cauliflower rice making it more mushy.\n\nCooking/ Packaging: they both come in single serving containers, but that\u2019s what we are here for. CookUnity containers are compostable material, while Factor comes in plastic. This means it less environmentally friendly, less healthy after heating (plastics), and more limited. CookUnity meals can be made in the ways I mentioned in my 1st paragraph (don\u2019t put the CookUnity container in a AirFryer unless you have good insurance!), while Factor, due to the sloppy base of cauliflower rice, can really only be heated in the microwave. CookUnity even gives directions for oven and microwave. CookUnity is delivered in a reusable bag that the delivery person with pick up when delivering your next order. Factor is a big box with a cooling pad and insulation lining.\n\nAdvice:\nBe adventurous!: A huge value here is adding variety and eating meals you might never make yourself, so take advantage of that!\n\nThat said, have some guidelines. Stick to proteins you know you will like or look for atleast one ingredient you know you know you will like even if the rest of the dish is a mystery. With factor, always choose whole proteins. Their diced or sliced proteins always tend be mushy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the meal, call the company and tell them!!! They will credit you the cost of the meal almost every time. Both companies have pretty friendly customer service teams.\n\nTake Advantage of your discounts!: Order as many meals as makes sense based on pricing, especially for CookUnity. Maybe not factor, but that\u2019s my biased, which is everything so far anyways. After so many meals in an order, they start to go up in price due to shipping and the company not wanting to get totally burned. I\u2019ve found that 14-18 meals gives you the best price point. Sure, from frozen is never better than from fresh, but if you are already eating frozen meals, that\u2019s a non-factor.\n\nPause your order: unless you plan to eat all those meals in a week, you will want to pause your order. If not, they will send you another shipment next week, with or without you selecting meals.\n\nYes, pause your order before canceling. Especially if you are brand hopping. Most of the companies will offer you more discounts when you try to cancel. If you are brand hopping, use their initial discounts while pause the companies you\u2019ve already used. Once you\u2019ve cycled through all the companies you want to try, go back and cancel the 1st one you went to, take the discount and stock up again! You can make these discounts last a really long time if you do this.\n\nBe sorta thoughtful about which meals might freeze better than others. When I get my order, I immediately freeze a large portion and keep a few in my fridge for the upcoming week. Example, I don\u2019t think leafy greens freeze well, so I eat those 1st. I think they will all freeze and reheat fine, but, maybe give it some consideration.\n\nI am not paid by CookUnity on anything, just really happy I found them. But hey, if someone at CookUnity sees this, I\u2019m totally down to write more reviews in exchange for discounts! Comment below!\n\nI have not tried any of the others: Tempo by homechef, hello fresh\u2019s or blue apron\u2019s new line or the few others out there. I also have not tried the packaged meals from HelloFresh or Blue Apron. I think I might give HelloFresh and Blue Apron a try in the future once I\u2019m done getting all I can out of these companies. They have been around awhile and I have heard decent things about them or been recommended by friend to try their packaged meals. If anyone wants to build some callouses on their fingers and give me a run down on those groups, please do.\n\nMaybe, I\u2019ll come back with more info and edit or comment later, but that\u2019s all I can think of for now. \n\nThanks for coming to my T.E.D talk.",

I answered their questions, they showed me dairy-free meals, everything seemed great.

So, like any reasonable person, I **paused my account** to avoid being charged\u2014because why would I pay for meals I *can\u2019t even eat*? Fast forward to today, I check my bank statement and see they **charged me on 2/15.**\n\nI immediately reached out for a refund. And guess what? They hit me with, *\u201cThe order was already processed, and we don\u2019t offer refunds for first orders.\u201d* But wasn\u2019t the whole point of pausing **to stop the order from being processed and my card from being charged?!** They just kept repeating, *\u201cYour order was already processed,\u201d* like that magically makes their scam okay.

They **only** let you cancel after your first order, and guess what? **No refunds.** They bury this in their terms and conditions, so if your food is bad or something goes wrong, you\u2019re stuck.

      "text": "**The good:**\n\n* The promotional price was insanely low.  $12 for 6 prepared meals AND 6 large chocolate chip cookies.  And free shipping!\n* The meals were filling, around 500-700 calories each.\n* The cookies were easy to make (just throw in the toaster oven for 15 minutes) and delicious!  And quite decent ingredients, too, like real vanilla and nothing sketchy!\n\n**The really really awful**\n\n* The meals were not even remotely nutritionally balanced.  Slivers of veg at most.\n* Their texture was honestly the worst I have ever experienced in a prepared meal, and that includes airplane meals.  If the King of Thailand had the misfortune of trying Gobble's pad thai, I think he would sentence the entire Gobble team to a terrible fate that I'm not sure I can mention on Reddit.  Among other things, the shrimp could be used either to make childrens' bouncy balls OR, I'm convinced, transmogrified into fishy &amp; dangerous weapons of great destruction.\n* Worse still, the meals' flavor profile... was also worse than the worst prepared meals I can ever remember eating.  And to put this in perspective, I've tried lots of delivery options like Tovala (pricey but pretty good!), CookUnity (not bad), HomeChef (mixed), and Factor (oof, no) by mail, and various frozen foods at the grocery store (which have generally been... okay, not great).\n\nSomehow Gobble managed to make even mac and cheese -- one of those foods where even when it's mediocre it's still typically a guilty pleasure -- be such so mushy and flavorless that I could barely force myself to finish it.  And that was one of the, ahem, less awful Gobble meals.\n\nHOW bad are they?  I ate 5, regret eating those 5, and am finally sensibly composting the 6th one.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have access to the same promotional pricing I did, I actually (semi-seriously) suggest you buy this anonymously for someone you hate.  It's a cheap enough evil 'gift' that may torture the other person up to 6 times (!).\n\nJust don't include the chocolate chip cookies, since as noted, those were actually delightful.",

I saw CookUnity but never heard of them.\n\nI've been using Factor for the last month and its been great. Food is great and saves me a lot of time.  \nMy issue is that I don't eat Pork (no disrespect, if you eat it, all power to you).\n\nI was eating my dinner when I was reading the ingredients and saw that the meal I was eating had Gelatin (which is usually derived from pork). Whatever, not the end of the world, its a sub sub ingredient of swine, no big deal.\n\nBut after reading that I wanted to reach out to customer service and see if I could filter out certain ingredients, what I found out later was that a lot of the meals that don't have pork in them (as a protein) are actually cooked with pork fat. OK WOW!\n\nThe issue with that is that pork fat isn't listed as an ingredient on their website. They only list the ingredients you can see or taste. So the only way to know for sure is to buy the product, have it shipped to me and then manually read EACH ingredient on the back of the box (which isn't a short list by any means). This is pretty messed up. I mean its a food company, you should know there's a good chunk if people that don't eat pork at least make an effort to filter this shit out.",

I'm embarrassed for the details but I want opinions based on the facts. My condition remained and the pain was so bad in the middle of the night I had to take anti-diah medicine left over from when I had Covid. This morning was more of the same so I took another tablet.

It's the second day and my symptoms keep returning intermittently, although not as bad as before. \n\nI'm not certain my symptoms were caused by tainted pork and admit this could be a total coincidence - which is why I'm creating this post.

      "title": "Cook Unity vs Factor -- My Observations",
      "text": "I purchase the meals that are under 650 calories and mostly only eat the seafood so this review will focus on mainly those meals.\n\nAt 59, I am so done with cooking and was looking for something easy, healthy, and lower in calories (am down 30 lbs since I started).\n\nI have had Cook Unity (CU) for nearly 6 months and have been very pleased.  I obviously live in a good area with a good local delivery service as I have never had any issues with packaging or delivery.  I have read comments that noted the delivery and packing were not good.  I live in northern Ohio and my meals come from New York.  They get dropped off to a local spot where drivers then deliver them on their assigned routes.  My local spot is about an hour from me and my meals have always been cold when they arrive.  \n\nI eat a lot of salmon and they have many different recipes -- different seasonings and different sauces -- so that it doesn't always seem like I am eating the same salmon over and over.  Same with the shrimp meals. I especially like the cold shrimp grain bowls (I LOVE farro and quinoa!).  In six months I have had one meal that I did not think was prepared very well -- overcooked falafel.  CU was very quick to issue me a credit toward my next meal so I was satisfied.  I simply emailed them and sent a pic of the meal.  So, only one 'bad' meal in six months is, to me, very good!\n\nI did try a few of the non-seafood meals and they weren't to my liking.  However, I love the seafood (or just vegetarian) meals and I find there is enough of a variety that I don't feel limited.\n\nMany times I halve the meals and add my own extras (cooked spinach, more grains, etc.) and can make the meal into 2 servings.  I eat 4 smaller meals a day and use the CU as one of my main meals so I am not looking for HUGE portions that would fill up a growing teen or adult male.  \n\n  \nI tried Factor for two weeks.  They deliver via FedEx so you are at their mercy.  They do indicate that the shipments could be a day later than your desired delivery date and that did happen to me once.  The way they pack them was good though and my meals stayed cold.  For those that complain they were left out in the hot sun -- what else is the FedEx (or any delivery person) going to to?  Bring them into your fridge?  For both CU and Factor, you can track your meals so you do know when they will arrive.  I make sure I am home so I can bring them inside as soon as they are delivered.  It's just common sense!\n\nFactor had a few beef meals that looked tasty so I tried them.  I am not a huge meat eater and do not eat 'chunks' of meat lol but I did try a few of their shredded beef dishes and they were both very good. Their smoke gouda shredded beef mac and cheese was fantastic!  Also, their egg bites were very very good!  I would cook some spinach and mushrooms and add an egg bite broken up into it for a full breakfast (the package comes with two).  \n\n  \nOverall, however, I feel the quality of CU is superior to Factor.  CU's shrimp are grilled and seasoned, whereas Factor simply throws pre-cooked shrimp (like you would buy at the grocery store) into whatever their shrimp dish is.  It's not cooked IN the dish or with any type of seasonings.  \n\nAlso, the sides (veggies generally) in Factor are more often just steamed, whereas CU will have at the least, a very tasty garlic butter or some kind of sauce with them.  I also like that CU packages their sauces separately in a small container because you can heat it up separately (or add it to the meal when it is closer to being cooked so it doesn't 'cook away'.  I don't get pasta dishes so I am not referring to that kind of sauce -- I mean the dill sauce or whatever that goes with like a salmon meal.\n\nOverall, if I had not had CU, I would be more satisfied with Factor but I feel CU's meals are more tasty.  I will still order Factor now and again but will definitely order CU much more often.  And, again, I can't speak for the chicken/beef/pork dishes, but as far as the seafood meals go, they are very tasty and anyone that says otherwise is not being honest.  I am very picky about my food!  I skipped a week once and went to the grocery store and bought the 'expensive' frozen single meals and couldn't even eat them they were so bland!\n\nI am going to be getting a Mighty Meals delivery next week and will compare that one as well.  I hope this has been helpful!!\n\n",

I\u2019m just shocked that this is 990 cal for the amount that it is it just doesn\u2019t seem calculated correctly especially because I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot of sauce on this to cover the noodles.\n\nThe reason I was kind of drawn in to cook unity was because there were so many options. Which is one of the reasons I stopped using Factor was it felt like the same meals every week. However, I\u2019m more than halfway through the meals that I ordered and they all just seem so bland. \nI\u2019m just wondering if maybe the quality has gone down or what other peoples opinions are I also got the free cookies for life when I signed up however, my cookie was smashed a bits from the packaging which also was not great. They said it would be delivered between 12 and eight on Sunday and I don\u2019t think it would have been cold and fresh had I not been home majority of the ice was kind of melted already. \n\nI\u2019ve made sure I\u2019ve paused it, but curious to know what some people\u2019s favorites are I tried to do a variety of Mexican-American Asian dishes with a protein and a carb or protein and veggie. I\u2019m a pretty open eater.. ",

They do rotating seasonal veggie and fruit boxes, but also have healthy groceries.\n\nSome of my favorites lately are: gum drop grapes, mangoes, fresh cilantro, tart cherries, dandelion greens, bone broth, yogurt with date paste, guacamole, and cocojune yogurt as well. They have gluten free items too like pizza dough, frozen spring rolls, bread.\n\nI used to rely on Cook Unity regularly, but their quality was going downwards and the post about the worm in the fish really disgusted me. So, now I\u2019ve been trying to meal prep  and cook my own food. \n\nIt\u2019s great to have nutritious and fresh stuff on hand, short of subscribing to a CSA, this stuff is way more farm fresh than Whole Foods or TJ\u2019s produce. Meal prepping is hard, so it helps that it\u2019s tasty!! \n\nIt is on the pricier side with the groceries, but the farm box is a great deal, a good box of produce for 25-50$ depending on size. Happy to provide more recommendations on items/answer questions below!! ",

      "text": "I know that ultimately buying sales, bulk, rice, beans, veg, rebate apps and cooking at home is the cheapest. However, I think for a lot of people finding a middle ground in our busy lives can ease some stress. \n\nI will say my family tried hellofresh. They liked it at first but over the months, their quality went down and they often felt like they didn't want to cook the meals to use them up when they weren't feeling that dish. It was definitely $12 or more a meal.\n\nLater, I had a friend who introduced me to cookunity, which I liked at first, especially their wide variety of vegan options made by chefs and delivered fresh. Often times though my meals broke open in transit. They were good about credits but it was still annoying and I was paying $13 a meal. I still used that for a bit then quit as I didn't like their selection anymore and felt their portions were rather not satisfying for what i paid. \n\nAnyway. Leave it to Facebook to save my laziness with cooking because I saw and ad for The Cumin Club and I was intrigued. They claimed $5 or so a meal and I gave them a fair look since I like Indian food and find it comforting and nourishing. I decided to try it though I didn't know really what the dishes were going to taste like that I was getting. They are all vegetarian with a lot of vegan options.\n\nThe packages are dried mixes that make 1-2 servings of food depending what you pair with them like rice or protein. I find that they still taste awesome heated on the stove and I often pair mine with rice. I think you can also microwave them in a bowl. Many options to choose from. I had one called Sambar idiy last night. It exceeded my expectations in taste! A lot of the packages also have pictures of the dishes so you could sometimes get an idea of what it would be like. No messy ice bags to deal with, no food breaking open in transit, no food going bad before you feel like eating it, and like half the cost. \n\nTo make the meals more nutritious I definitely do recommend adding 1/2 cup brown rice and 1/2 cup frozen vegetables like carrots, green beans, and peas to some of the dishes. Peas also count as a good added protein. Chickpeas may also be good in some. With that, you are looking at maybe 6-7$ for 1-2 fairly nutritious meals? Depends on your pairings and how much u spent for those I suppose. That's still half the cost of eating out, especially if you work and get lunch in a city.\n\nI take a picture of the package that I have for a certain day and draw a rating out of 5 on them so i know which ones I would order again since I'm not going to remember the Indian names. \n\nJust genuinely wanted to share something I'm enjoying that may be in some people's budget of frugal. :)",
