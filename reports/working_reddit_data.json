There\u2019s lots of elderly folks, some living alone, on this street.

      "selftext": "Apologies for yet another post on the subject. I just felt this was warranted. Look, I love the Hello Fresh subscription I have and I'm only invested in the wellbeing of that service for personal reasons, so I see AI-based enshittification as a bit of a threat to that. \n\nThe CEO proudly states this quote in speaking with a journalist at Forbes [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenwunker/2025/11/06/hellofreshs-recipe-revolution-why-ai-personalization-meant-redesign/)\n\nIn the article they state they were able to take a three month pipeline and reduce it down to three hours. It's a pretty bold claim, coming from the stakeholder who decided to [invest $70 million into their AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/exclusive-hellofresh-invests-70-million-to-have-ai-help-plan-dinner), you need to take such statements with a grain of salt. They essentially automated the asset pipeline behind recipes. As many have observed, recipe steps get AI photos, recipes are passed through LLMs for normalization and so on.\n\n> Initially, AI created drafts while human editors drove the process. As confidence grew, humans shifted to review mode. As Ronen puts it, they rode \"shotgun in the car\" rather than behind the wheel. Only after the system consistently matched or exceeded human output did HelloFresh fully deploy it.\n\nBut the Forbes article reveals a deeper issue: *the fact the CEO wants to be more of a tech company than a food company.* \n\nYou don't say stuff like this. Like this is just outright stupid PR and now my trust in the company has tanked knowing the captain of the ship probably has photos of Sam Altman and Mark Zuckerberg behind his desk on the wall instead of Jacques P\u00e9pin or Alton Brown. \n\nI can't help but be reminded of the recent video circulating of the [tech CEO rapping to a roomful of his subordinates](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/s/N34U6rc28a), many of whom gleefully smile on. \n\nYou are not a tech company, Hello Fresh. You are not a flimsy algorithm or asset production pipeline. Those things are all in service to your primary purpose: **recipe curation and automated grocery shopping.**\n\nInvest your humans in that. Humans need to be driving the car, not riding shotgun. They need to be involved in the tedious steps of translating recipes to cards because that is where you need to build expertise and artistry. Yes, you should continue to pay food photographers and yes it should take months because that's the constraints of craftsmanship. It should cost time and money, because it should be thoroughly vetted. AI can definitely be involved, only as a service to the artists who get more time to craft better quality output. \n\nOr you can ignore this warning - and watch as customers suddenly see every fault, every mistake, every time they get annoyed by a step in a recipe, begin to question if this is because of AI, and begin to wonder what value they're getting out of the service. \n\nWhen the groceries aren't even that good and the recipes aren't even being curated anymore, and customers start leaving in swathes, at least you'll be able to say now \"we are a tech company\" and maybe you can pivot into something stupid like \"tinder for recipes.\"",

You\u2019ll probably see her jumping into threads to answer questions, share tips, talk through menu picks, or just join the conversation when someone posts a great photo of their meal. She\u2019s here to add value, be helpful, and listen to what this community cares about.\n\n**Who Katie is:**\n\n* She is a real human with feelings, a life, and a messy kitchen at least once a week. Let\u2019s keep the community energy kind and welcoming like it always is.\n* She is a HelloFresh customer herself. She can give you her own personal tips and maybe share some of her own cooking wins and fails. \n* She is here to listen and share feedback with her team at HelloFresh.\n\n**Who Katie isn\u2019t:**\n\n* She is not customer service. She can help you out and nudge you in the right direction, but official account issues still need to go through the HelloFresh customer care team. \n* **She is not a moderator.** The sub stays fully independent of HelloFresh, nothing about that is changing.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for fun down the road, including AMAs with HelloFresh Chefs, behind the scenes kitchen moments, cooking chats, new recipe launches, and more.\n\nWe'll be giving her some official flair shortly.\n\n\nSo please give her a warm welcome, and keep an eye out for her around the sub as u/KatieFromHelloFresh!",

      "selftext": "Been a Factor customer for over 3 years now, order meals every single week to be delivered to my elderly parents.  Factor is 75% of their meal intake, they have no other way to get out of the house easily for meals as they are shut-ins.  \n\nMy parents have a fixed income, can only spend so much on food.  So I let them spend what they WANT to spend on food, and I supplement that by buying Factor gift cards with my own credit card to get them enough funds to cover their weekly meals.  I usually buy 1 month worth of gift cards, from Factor themselves mind you (not a prepaid Visa or anything), and then all works fine\u2026.for like a month.\n\nBut EVERY SINGLE TIME, once that gift card is used up, EVEN WITH THE SAME CREDIT CARD ON FILE to cover the remainder guess what happens?  FACTOR CANCELS MY ACCOUNT.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  This has happened over a DOZEN times in the past 3 years.  Each time, I have to call Factor support who INSISTS that I deactivated my own account.  IVE NEVER DEACTIVATED MY ACCOUNT.\n\nMy theory: There\u2019s something in their eComm cart/payment logic that wants to drain the funds on the gift card FIRST and if that balance hits zero, it automatically-deactivates your account and will NOT shift over to the credit card on file.  I\u2019ve tried to prove this to the support team, they literally call me a liar/idiot and say I MUST have deactivated my account (Never, ever have I done so\u2026but this is getting me furious enough to want to do that).  And once the account has become deactivated, I have to call back in and go through TONS of hoops to get it reactivated, arguing with multiple support personnel that they have a problem they aren\u2019t acknowledging on their side.  Ultimately, they even end up giving me free food shipments, which I don\u2019t even care about and here\u2019s why\u2026.because when I get my account deactivated using THEIR gift cards on THEIR website, they end up skipping entire weeks\u2019 worth of meal services to my parents and I have to resort to online grocery deliveries, DoorDash deliveries or whatever to feed them for that week.\n\nLook, if I had alternatives to FACTOR I would use them.  Unfortunately for where my elderly parents live, I do not.  They like the food (I don\u2019t) and usually the service.  But this is beyond aggravating.  I don\u2019t understand why they won\u2019t acknowledge they have an obvious bug.\n\nAnyone have an escalation path to their head of techology, billing or an executive there?  I\u2019m not kidding\u2026.probably have spend $12K+ on Factor food and they keep KICKING ME OFF THEIR SYSTEM.",

(Something like CookUnity, Mighty Meals, Factor 75, etc.)\n\nI currently live on a diet of frozen pizza and canned pasta and I'm looking to change that. \n\nA couple of things:\n\nA. I need good portion sizes. Seriously, I can't with how a lot of companies skimp on portion sizes and I get extremely hungry. (As an example, I tried Hungry Root and those meals didn't fill me up at all.)\n\nB. I'm in the Central Kentucky area. (I've heard your location can determine the quality of certain services, so I wanted to put that out there.)\n\nI've got no special allergies or diet restrictions, thankfully. \n\nAgain, I'm looking for *recommendations*. There's plenty of posts I can find if I want to look up complaints, I'm trying to see what people actually like.",

      "selftext": "Ordered one of their \u201cfree\u201d boxes with a second box at a discount via my roommates promo cards. On my first one, I only got the microwaveable ones. I had 2 salads and some smoothie/matcha thing in there for their \u201c6\u201d items. So I got 3 items, when it was supposed to be 6. \n\nI also had  to call them 3 times because they charged me 95 bucks for the promo. And I have to call them again. And then again. By this time, they did refund everything except shipping costs for half of my order.\n\nI call them again today because I have another charge on my card and tell them just to F off and cancel it, because having 3 different people telling me different things isn\u2019t \u201cconvenient\u201d like they LOVE to promote - which is why I wanted it. Cool, all is good\u2026 you would think.\n\nThen I cook this box of BULLSHIT and realize I have a piece of fucking plastic in my teeth and\u2026 wow. It\u2019s not possible for this to happen during shipping, due to how much insulation is in the box. I\u2019m also going to add that my roommate left town for a week and half and had 3 boxes delivered in this time, even though he tried to change the date more than once. \n\nF this company. F factor. Fucking. Scam. Stay away. ",

Only when we started opening the bags were we hit with the worst moldy vegetable stink. I can\u2019t even begin to describe it, like imagine someone soaked dill in hot pee for days on end and soaked the box. My garbage and my refrigerator still smell like this horrible stink and nothing has worked so far. Best BA customer service could do is give me a $10 CREDIT because the box was in their words \u201ca day late\u201d (5 days late but ok) \n\n\nI\u2019ve been a big defender of BA for years, consistent subscriber since 2015, kept with it despite the rapidly declining quality in ingredients/recipe variety/customer service, never complained about my default meal selections always including meat stuffs like hamburgers (consistently veg diet in my BA history btw), and I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve looked at other mealkit options and honestly until someone can vouch for the produce quality I\u2019m just gonna go back to meal planning on weekends and hitting up the grocery store. If others are still having a good BA experience, great! This has been the worst week yet, my kitchen is still recovering, and I can never eat dill again. ",

This week, I am supposed to have my delivery by 8 PM tonight however there\u2019s no tracking and the tracking website doesn\u2019t even state that it is out for delivery. \n\nThey have great customer service and I\u2019m not worried about not getting a refund or anything.
