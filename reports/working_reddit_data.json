I actually gave half their portion to my husband bc I figured kid wasn't going to be interested in something that different and new. Now I feel bad because they would have eaten the whole thing!\n\n\n\nWhile I agree that the protein portions were a little on the small side (though double would have been too much), I feel like the rice and carrots more than made up for it. The rice they send for 4 people is A LOT for us, which is fine bc my kids will eat plain rice as leftovers :D I didn't even cook all of the carrots because those suckers were HUGE, and we still had leftovers which I'll happily eat for lunch.\n\n\n\nI really appreciated the balance of ease in cooking on a weeknight with the flavors being interesting, like adding lime zest to the roasted carrots.\n\n\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't get a photo before everyone CHOWED DOWN.

Their meat was never terrible to me (it was fine). Not high quality, but still fine. However, since about a month ago, I have found their meat to be quite awful, particularly the ground meat (including sausage). It seems to be filled with a lot of filler or something because it reminds me almost of hot dogs if they were ripped into pieces, but ofc, the taste is not the same as hot dogs but it also doesn't taste like it should. I have never experienced this with ground meats that I purchased elsewhere... \n\nI am definitely going to cancel next month (my partner asked we do it for the next month as we are busy) and, in the meantime, avoid the ground meats but it is unfortunate because they are often in quicker meals. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this?

I couldn\u2019t decide between them so because they were not premium and they both had the same time it would take and the same difficulty level, I got both. I may end up regretting that by the end of Sunday when I do the second one.\n\nI thought this was pretty good, especially the rice, probably in part because it contained the drippings from the chicken. The chicken itself was pretty good, with seasoning it at the beginning with a combo of garlic powder and salt and then towards the end, basting it with some sweet soy glaze. I think it took me about an hour and 45 minutes total, but a lot of that was waiting for things to cook, especially the chicken. I\u2019m not sure it needed 3 sauces but fortunately, there was only one that was cooked, ginger scallion sauce, though I didn\u2019t particularly like it. I didn\u2019t think this recipe was particularly hard, though it\u2019s labeled as such, just involved and it took awhile to cook as half chickens typically do\n\nI really recommend this recipe\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of the first serving, with the leg part\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhsvxj4tonvf1.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfd8eb6dbe55532e9d7ff354855a721ceb619f86",

I put some of the mac and cheese on the burger. I also caramelized the onions the correct way, and did not add the sugar and splash of water to shortcut how long it takes to actually caramelize onions. I also tossed a slice of white cheddar I had in the fridge on the burger before platting.\n\nI will of course save the non used potatoes to use in any potatoe dishes I may get next week as when making mash, then always send the world's smallest potatoes.",

      "title": "Honest Hungryroot review",
      "selftext": "I've been trying Hungryroot for a few months now and here's my review. \n\n1. To start, I have a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions which had me extremely stressed when trying to look up recipes and make food. I was desperate to find something to make my life easier.  I did the quiz on their website and of course they wanted me to pay before seeing the food options. No thanks. I emailed customer service and they basically gave me \"we have a lot of options so give us a try\" answer. Um, no. Not if I don't know if I can eat the food! After some back and forth and a bad review for the rep I finally received the link for all of their food options. I found a few recipes I could eat so I decided to give it a try. Sifting through the food options does become a lot easier after you sign up because you can kind of create your profile and preferences. I do not like this, I wish they were transparent about everything from the beginning.\n2. I've gotten probably 8 boxes by now, 1 has been late and some of the food was bad. I've had a few bad items in multiple boxes. I've always gotten a quick refund with extra for the inconvenience and they say they talked to the packing team. My last box was perfect so hopefully things are improving? We shall see. (Of note: customer service starting after my first interaction has been very good)\n3. I pay about $105 each week for just me. This includes \"points\" for 3 lunches, 4 dinners, and 5-7 servings of sweets. Portion sizes are huge in my opinion. I started stretching this out for almost every meal for the week. I always end up eating somewhere else for 1-2 meals for the week but the food I get from hungryroot lasts me for the rest of the week. If something tells me I can get 2 servings out of it, I can typically make it into 4 meals. I always end up having enough food to feed my husband a few meals out of the week as well.\n4. The food is pretty fresh which is a huge plus for me because I can't eat a lot of preservatives without issues. The downside is it spoils pretty quickly. I had 2 bags of mozzarella cheese in the fridge, one from Hungryroot and one from Walmart. The one from hungryroot has spoiled already in less than 2 months. \n5. 99% of the meals I've gotten take less than 20 minutes to make and are very easy. This is perfect because I really hate cooking and don't have a lot of time anyway. I did get one meal that took forever to make and it was awful so I try to keep to the more simple options. \n6. Most of the food I get is really tasty! I am a very picky eater (on top of everything else lol) so a huge plus for me.\n\nI'm conclusion, I will be keeping my hungryroot subscription because it makes my life so much easier. If I didn't have so many restrictions I probably wouldn't use it because of cost. I did look at quite a lot of meal service options and none of the others are as good for my dietary restrictions. Hope this helps someone looking into it. \n\n",

      "selftext": "TL:DR - Be open to long distance relationships. \n\nFor this post I\u2019ll be referring to the US &amp; Canada (because that\u2019s where I have experience) but what I want to share probably applies to other countries. \n\nI have been vegan for 5 years now and I\u2019ve frequented this subreddit for about 4 years. One of the most common post I see are posts about finding other vegans to date. Most of these posts seem to have a common theme about loneliness (or feeling lonely) and/or the lack of potential vegan partners. As we all probably know by now, there are about 4 million vegans (assuming all are adults) out of about 300 million adults (US &amp; Canada). Basically, your chances of finding a vegan in your state/province/city are incredibly low, albeit not impossible. \n\nGiven this information, I think vegans should be open to long distance relationships (LDRs). LDRs can be difficult for a myriad of reasons, namely not seeing your significant other for potentially months at a time, developing deep trust, and cost of traveling. However, I think all of those factors have to be weighed in comparison to not having a romantic partner at all. \n\nI went most of my vegan tenure without having a vegan partner and it was quite lonely from a romantic standpoint. Realizing just how few vegans there are, I opened myself up to doing LDRs. Upon doing so, I met my wonderful girlfriend who aligned with my beliefs, values, and lifestyle in almost every way. Initially we had a 3 hour time difference, but eventually, through sheer dedication to each other, we don\u2019t have a time difference anymore and we are only a hour away from each other. There\u2019s still more work for us to do before we can close the distance completely, but like I mentioned earlier, we compared not having each to having each other and we gladly chose the latter. \n\nMy heart goes out to all of you vegans who are struggling with negative feelings around not having the relationships you want in your life. Trust me, I was there for many years. I believe you all can achieve what you want in your life, but it may require being open to unconventional things. \ud83c\udf31",

      "selftext": "I (35male) am struggling to save, budget, plan for my future. I currently work for a law firm that I've been with for 6 months. Im eligible for their 401k and I believe other retirement plans, but the thought of my check being any lower frightens me. Im currently making 70k a year. Started at 60k to get my foot through the door, but was able to convince them for a jump. Still working on another 5-10 by February. Thankfully my health insurance is removed pre tax at 149 every two weeks.\n\nMonthly, I have 2400 in responsibilities. I pay my rent, utilities, half my mothers rent, car, car ins, phone for mother and I, and youtibe premium (only sub I have).\n\nAfter bills, im left with 1100 each check. Then we have groceries, groceries for my mom, gas, tolls (fl). Im also paying monthly for back taxes from 2023 since I filed late and apparently incorrectly. My ex wife and I split it in half but its 12k to pay off by March.\n\nFrankly, I'm just freaking out on how to manage myself, avoid debt, and avoid having the IRS get me and garnish my wages.\n\nOn top of this, after my divorce I was with no insurance. I have crohns disease and have to have monthly infusions for the rest of my life. Never had remission and doesn't seem like it'll happen. Now I told the clinic I was without insurance so I went 5 months without it. Which then led to a massive flare up, get hospitalized for two weeks and surgery. All with no insurance. Medical bills are piling and I can't even begin to factor them in my monthly.\n\nI know this isn't impossible and its possible to get back in the green. I just need help on a path to making the right choices, be stable, and plan for my future.\n\nAppreciate all who read up to here, and thank you for any advice you're able to give.",

      "title": "Is Dental School Worth It in My Situation? Need Honest Opinions",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI could really use some honest insight from those in dentistry or who\u2019ve been through similar crossroads. I\u2019m in a unique situation and debating whether going to dental school is worth it, financially and personally.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of my background:\n\t\u2022\tI\u2019m currently a ICU Registered Nurse (RN) in California, earning around $150K USD/year. It can go up to 250k USD/Year with some OT.\n\t\u2022\tMy spouse is in dental school and we plan to open a clinic a couple years after she\u2019s finished.\n\t\u2022\tI\u2019m 25 years old now and thinking of going dental school. It\u2019s a 4-year program and will cost me around $400K USD in tuition and expenses. I would have to take 10 prerequisite courses \n\t\n\nThe dilemma:\n\nIf I stay a nurse and invest my income + save the $400K I\u2019d spend on school, I can build a huge investment portfolio\u2014some scenarios I ran showed it could grow to $7M+ by age 60 just by investing in index funds with a 10% annual return.\n\nMeanwhile, becoming a dentist means 4 years of lost income, debt, and delayed investing. I\u2019d eventually make good money, but would I ever \u201ccatch up\u201d to the financial trajectory I\u2019d have as a nurse-investor with a high-earning spouse? Is the extra effort and debt really worth it?\n\nI could also go to CRNA school which would be 150k for school tuition and a 3 year program and they can make 250k - 300k a year.\n\nOther factors:\n\t\u2022\tI do enjoy healthcare and working with patients, and I think I\u2019d enjoy dentistry.\n\t\u2022\tBut I also enjoy the freedom, flexibility, and low stress of nursing, especially if I could pivot to part-time, travel nursing, or even other ventures.\n\t\u2022\tMy spouse will make excellent money once out of school, so we\u2019re financially secure either way.\n\t\u2022\tI\u2019m also quite entrepreneurial amd would love to scale the dental clinics for my wife and being a nurse would allow me the time to do that.\n\nI\u2019m torn between:\n\t1.\tFinishing dental school and eventually joining my wife in a big clinic (but with ~$400K sunk cost + 4 years lost)\n\t2.\tFocusing on nursing + entrepreneurship + investing, and letting her be the \u201cdoctor\u201d while I run our life and business ops.\n       3.  Go to CRNA school \n\nWhat would you do in my shoes? Is the DDS worth it in this case? Would love to hear from dentists, dental students, or anyone who\u2019s had to weigh a similar choice.",
