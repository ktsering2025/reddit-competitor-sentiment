            <p>I started with Home Chef and quickly realized I did not like cooking so I switched to their ready-made plan called Tempo. However, I am not sure I trust the ingredients. A packaged sauce with one of my Home Chef meals came with high-risk additives (according to the Yuka app, which I love and trust)....</p>

            <p>Honestly feels like meal kits are for people who can't plan meals or don't know how to cook. But we're both busy with work and tired of eating the same 5 things on rotation or ordering expensive takeout. Is Blue Apron actually good quality and interesting recipes or is it mediocre food at premium pr...</p>

            <p>After weeks of missing ingredients, poor substitutions (that they don’t even email about anymore), late deliveries, drivers placing the box right in front of the front door blocking the entry to folks in my building, soggy spinach, moldy vegetables….

            <p>This is my final straw…my whole box this weekend came soaking wet on the inside, with two bags of rotten arugula stinking up the whole box. My pork bag broke and leaked, and they decided to replace my ravioli with angel hair pasta??? They refunded me for my whole box but I need the money to go to my...</p>

            <p>Are you guys able to order premade Dishes in the app anymore? I no longer see the section to order them, and it's not a menu option like before. Did they get rid of this option or what?  Is it temporarily on hold or something? Premade Dishes was my whole reason for using Blue Apron. Is anyone else h...</p>

I don’t want to cancel, I like the recipes and the cooking is kinda at my level, I don’t have time to shop and meal plan much, but I’m gettin...</p>

            <p>We have had three deliveries and each time they sent meat (which we do not eat) and are missing a key ingredient to make a recipe. The whole reason I signed up for this was to save time, but for the THIRD TIME I need to make a special trip to the store to get what I need to use the rest of the groce...</p>
