            <p><strong>Engagement:</strong> 8 | <strong>Subreddit:</strong> r/CreditCards</p>
            <p>Got an offer for Citi Strata card with no annual fee. I‚Äôm mainly interested in it for 3x on grocery stores. I know when Chase offers a quarterly 5x for grocery, they view BA as a grocery store. 

Since we spend $100 a week with BA, I was wondering if Citi Strata also views them as grocery. 

Thanks ...</p>

            <p>Anyone have  cookbook suggestion for toddler lunches and/or super fast family dinners? Or meal services you liked? Hello fresh or blue apron? I‚Äôm running out of lunch and dinner ideas and I have no mental energy to even think of what to make.</p>

            <p>I see the official consensus on here is that BA service as a whole has completely tanked ever since the recent rebrand. I‚Äôve been a customer since 2020 and it used to be very unusual to have any problems other than an occasional ingredient substitution or more rarely something that came spoiled. Now...</p>

            <p>For anyone on the fence, do not waste your money.

This was hands down the worst meal service I have ever tried. I enjoy Blue Apron, HelloFresh, and Daily Harvest. They have their ups and downs but are overall good. 

Purple carrot was literally trash. Very old and rotten vegetables wrapped in way t...</p>

            <p>I subscribed to see what they had to offer. I browsed for a bit but didn‚Äôt like the options so I canceled my subscription 10 mins after signing up. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Today I get home to a big delivery from both. I check my credit card and I was charged for both. But I canceled, basically ...</p>

            <p>So, I have been loving hungryroot for several months now. However, for the last two (going on three) weeks now I haven't received our delivery. We keep getting the same answer from customer service that there was an issue with the shipment being lost (FedEx), but it's happened so often now it feels ...</p>
