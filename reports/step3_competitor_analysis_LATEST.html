            <p>We haven’t loved our meals lately and also are losing cooking motivation lol. We aren’t quite ready to completely cancel but also probably won’t order for at least a few weeks. How should we go about this?</p>

            <p>I see the official consensus on here is that BA service as a whole has completely tanked ever since the recent rebrand. I’ve been a customer since 2020 and it used to be very unusual to have any problems other than an occasional ingredient substitution or more rarely something that came spoiled. Now...</p>

            <p>I miss the old BA. 

After a long break, I reactivated my account. When I did the new recipe cards just came out. I don’t hate the new cards, but I did like the older ones better. Maybe it was because I was more familiar with them. 

But THEN… the app update. It is just horrible. I hate the layout, ...</p>

            <p>I subscribed to see what they had to offer. I browsed for a bit but didn’t like the options so I canceled my subscription 10 mins after signing up. Didn’t think anything of it. Today I get home to a big delivery from both. I check my credit card and I was charged for both. But I canceled, basically ...</p>

            <p>So, I have been loving hungryroot for several months now. However, for the last two (going on three) weeks now I haven't received our delivery. We keep getting the same answer from customer service that there was an issue with the shipment being lost (FedEx), but it's happened so often now it feels ...</p>
