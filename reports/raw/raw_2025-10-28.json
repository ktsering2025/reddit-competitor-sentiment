      "selftext": "Honestly feels like meal kits are for people who can't plan meals or don't know how to cook. But we're both busy with work and tired of eating the same 5 things on rotation or ordering expensive takeout. Is Blue Apron actually good quality and interesting recipes or is it mediocre food at premium prices?\n\nHas anyone used Blue Apron long term and think it's worth it? Do they even do Black Friday deals or is it just the constant new customer promotions? And for people who quit meal kits, did you find a better solution or just go back to regular grocery shopping?",
