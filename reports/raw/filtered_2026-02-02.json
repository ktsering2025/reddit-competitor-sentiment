I've had many issues with their ingredients (rotten upon arrival/missing entire meals/sending the wrong meal/having crushed ingredients). Each time I would report the concern through the app and they would say that they refunded me for the meal or the missing ingredients, so I didn't mind too much. \n\nFast forward to a week ago where my mom, who also uses hello fresh told me that she noticed that HF never refunded her when they said they would since her box never arrive. This made me check, and as you can guess, none of the refunds I was told I would get showed up in the last two months of credit card statements. \n\nTrying to contact HF was a nightmare. My mom was able to speak to someone on the phone and they refunded her right then and there, but I tried using the messaging platform and no one ever responded (pictured). I waited 50 minutes to speak with someone on the phone too. \n\nOverall, this combined with the general decrease in quality is making finally cancel my subscription \n Sucks bc I've used HF since 2018 and used to love it.

Because of this, my card information was somehow stolen from another HelloFresh user and they have been making insane transactions with my bank account. I'm talking like 2-3 charges a month that well exceeded $1000. It makes absolutely no sense how HelloFresh even allows one account to spend upwards to $800 per transaction for their product or services. Tell me how 1 box of meals can be $800+??!! They're taking no accountability and claiming my bank should be responsible. There was obviously some kind of data breach on their end that allowed this person to steal my card info and on top of that, a HUGE oversight on their part by allowing single transactions to exceed $800. If anyone has experienced anything like this, I would love to know so I can refer to this happening to other people!!!\n\n",

But I got looking and no one ever came by my house to drop anything off. I contacted the shipping company and they informed me that Factor cancelled my order the Friday prior. \n\nI was never notified of a cancellation. I checked my bank account, and there was no refund there. I called customer service and they said they had no idea why my box was cancelled, and they\u2019d give me a refund. Well the \u201crefund\u201d came in the form of credits on my account. I decided to give them another chance with another box. \n\nI talked to customer service last night because I wanted to make sure my credits would be applied to the box that will be arriving this coming Monday, and they assured me that the credits would be used. \n\nLo and behold I wake up this morning and my bank account was charged for the full amount and the credits are still on my factor account. Proceed to have ANOTHER conversation with customer service and got informed they can\u2019t do anything about it and they cant cancel my box. \n\nSo I told them to cancel my whole account.

WFH and Ubereats being the bane of my existence. For context, I've never really clicked with ready made meals. Particularly the Walmart ones I used to  get in my early 20's made me feel all kinds of bloated for hour after eating. That said, I was recently at a friend's place and tried one of her meals from cookunity an it honestly flipped my opinion. I can see why people are willing to pay for gourmet options. As far as next steps, I'm currently on the fence between Factor and CookUnity - leaning towards the latter based on menu variety. Anyone here running weight loss or niche diets like keto or low carb using ready meals? ",

Not sure if I\u2019ll continue once the promo goes away but definitely worth at least trying it at that price IMO. \n\nI added a photo to show an example of how the meals came. I think they are pretty high quality and nice flavor/portion sizes. On the lower calorie end overall but good protein still. The food arrived frozen which I don\u2019t mind because I needed to freeze them anyway and I felt that the veggies and things stayed crisp. Let me know if you have any questions! ",

I also practice my decorating skills with a decorating kit that I recently got as well. With cooking, I always cook a lot and enjoy cooking different things. I cook for others and they say it is pretty good, but I think I'm leaning more towards the pastry side of things because I enjoy that a lot more. I've been wrestling with the idea for a while to try and do this and I think I finally decided that I want to try and attempt this. My original plan was to try and do some culinary things in the summers when I'm not in school (I'm a dancer so this takes up a lot of my time) and to also have a side/backup job whenever I do graduate and I'm in the off season for dance or if I'm not getting dance gigs.

My box arrived at **10 PM**, when deliveries are supposed to be by 8 PM (and are usually there by late afternoon), so I wasn\u2019t able to cook dinner at all.\n\nWhen I opened it, I realized the meals were completely wrong. I ordered 4 meals and received 3 \u2014 none of which I selected. One of them also contained gluten, which I can\u2019t eat.\n\nI\u2019m planning to contact customer service when they open. For those who\u2019ve had similar issues, did you get a full box refund or credits? What\u2019s been your experience?",

After 2 weeks, I haven\u2019t gotten the chance.\n\nI was supposed to receive my first delivery in Manhattan last Saturday, but it was apparently delayed because of the storm. I pointed out to customer service that the storm didn\u2019t start until Sunday, but that logic seemed beyond them. The package never showed up, and I got a refund.\n\nI gave it another shot and scheduled a delivery for today. But it\u2019s 6 pm, and I haven\u2019t received it. The OnTrac delivery estimate is still today, but it hasn\u2019t been updated in over 24 hours when the package was supposedly received.\n\nHas anyone else in NYC had a similar experience? Did you find any solutions? Does anyone know which days have a different delivery vendor? I was genuinely excited about Hungry Root and want it to work, but I can\u2019t deal with this every week.",

I am beyond frustrated, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything I can do to avoid this from happening. I\u2019ve had customer support add detailed instructions for delivery, but you can\u2019t force a delivery drive to READ AN ADDRESS CORRECTLY. ",
