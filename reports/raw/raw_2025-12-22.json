I needed a refund on a box as they sent me what looked like someone else\u2019s box, completely different meals to what I had ordered. The agent refused the refund and cancelled my subscription but the chat was still open so I asked \u201cwhy did you cancel my subscription without my consent?\u201d To that the agent said \u201coh I am so sorry, let me apply discounts on all future meals\u201d and from what I can see all future meals have significant discounts applied.

      "selftext": "So im curious if it's just me or not. Have been doing hf for a while now but noticed about a month ago that all the protein items are no longer tightly vacuum sealed. Before they were always tightly sealed with little room for movement but then about a month ago I noticed they all are now arriving only sealed about 1/4\" from the edge instead of mostly sealed as close to the meat as possible, so its mostly just a floppy pouch of plastic filled with liquid and a little meat and at least 1 (often times more like half or more) package there will be lines running through where it was sealed as if it wasn't aligned properly during the sealing process. This leaves me always guessing whether or not it's even safe to eat anymore  after 2-3 days. I know the saying when in doubt throw it out, but for me thats not super helpful bc I always think fresh meats smell gross so I don't know how to tell whether or not its safe anymore. And then there's the added fun of my last two boxes having to play the which one of these dripping packages of meat is actually the one leaking. So I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced a change like this recently. \n\nSide note: I also had a complete packaging change with my most recent box (delivered Saturday 12/13) instead of the usual liner that flips over the top to help keep it insulated and 2 icepacks, they put everything in one big brown paper bag with one icepack on the bottom and that was it. Nothing to help keep it cold or the contents in place at all, didn't even fold down the top. I truly hope it was just someone new or something bc if my box is packaged the same this week ill be cancelling and I really don't want to but i live in a rural area so my box doesn't get here till at least 8-9pm usually and even with the weather being colder now its usually still upwards of mid 60s to lower 70s during the day at the coolest so a brown paper bag with one icepack at the bottom tossed open in a huge cardboard box is not going to cut it to keep the ingredients well enough to be fit for consumption more than a couple days past arrival at most which wont work for an entire weeks worth of meals.

There's so many providers to choose from! I'm not sure where to start, who's good, who's on the \"avoid it!\" list, etc.\n\nI'm single, 40m, for ref, so don't need any family-sized kits. Living the bachelor life, and enjoying it, but trying to get into better physical shape again as I begin to hit mid-life.\n\n* Does anyone here have any recommendations as to providers and best ways to get started?\n* Is it mainly just a \"pick a provider and try it out\" thing? Or does this sub have a list of recommended top providers?\n* Anything to watch for in meal kit providers and meal kits in general?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, as I'm a brand-new rookie.\n\n  \nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for the solid advice! I went ahead and started with **HelloFresh**. Ordered my first box to arrive on the first week of the year! We'll see how this goes. Everything is under 1000 calories and quite healthy. I'm curious to try this out now. ",

Food is great, protein options are good, and it is much cheaper than eating out all the time. \n\n\nI had never personally done a meal kit service. My partner and I both work full time and I am about to be in law school. Ergo, we have very little free time, lol. We normally eat out a *LOT*, which was costing us far more than HungryRoot does, and HR does have much healthier food. \n\nAs a bonus, we are Native American and if it was more affordable, I'd eat bison for every meal. Finding a meal service that offers a *very* significant amount of options that use bison is incredible - and the amount of \"points\" a premium protein like that costs is really not that much higher than beef on HR. Their bison garlic and herb stew is *fantastic*. \n\nOur plan is $150-ish per week and we usually get around 4-5 (dinners only) 3 serving meals plus a few snacks because my bf is a volume eater, lol. This is adding a lot of variety and vegetables to our diet which I really appreciate. \n\nFor our first week, we tried out:\n\n\n- Bison garlic and herb stew: 5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n- Creamy chicken enchiladas: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f (I halved the cream cheese, full container would've been way too much, half still felt like a lot)\n\n- Bison burgers and superfood blend: 5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n- Black pepper chicken mixed veg stir fry: 4.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f (wish there were more veggies, i.e. edamame)\n\n- Creamy bison chiocciole pasta: 5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nPlus a few snacks. Hummus and chips, turkey and buffalo chicken sticks, etc. Our free item this week was a lemon pepper half chicken which i think I'll airfry tomorrow. \n\n\nWe have loved everything! I am pleasantly surprised. YMMV as I do add extra seasoning to everything. \ud83d\ude42 ",

The chat agent is broken and not working via Safari or Chrome, so I can\u2019t even speak with someone to find out if my meals are coming. I normally get a text message to say my meals are out for delivery but I did not receive a message today, nor did I receive my delivery today. So are my meals going to be delivered? Or not? I go to bed at 8PM because I get up very early for work. Given we ordered meals, we didn\u2019t go food shopping for the week. So in the absence of a food delivery, we\u2019re screwed. Feeling like Factor has screwed me again. This isn\u2019t right. \n\n7 years ago, I had Hello Fresh. Same B.S. And they kept billing me. Canceled my subscription and they billed me again. I terminated my card and had the bank send me a new card to stop Hello Fresh BS. I\u2019m trying not to overreact but I\u2019m having a hard time not going there. I rely on these pricks to provide meals. That\u2019s what I pay them for. But there\u2019s no phone number. There\u2019s no way to ask to speak with someone on a phone. Customer service sucks.

I've tried different meal kits, but hungryroot hits my perfect balance of easy-to-make (because cooking is simply a chore to me) and healthy!\n\nI came home from work very hungry.... During the drive home I was constantly debating in my head whether or not I should go get Wendy's or eat from the box I got. I forgot to choose my items for the week so they gave me what they thought I'd like, so I didn't really remember what I had in the fridge.\n\nBut I just had a whole wheat bagel, one side spread with organic probiotic garlic herb cream cheese, and the other side I put havarti and turkey slices all from the box. I'm so happy!!! I hate grocery shopping!! I love hungryroot!!!",
