      "selftext": "For the past several months, I've noticed a major decrease in Quality Assurance with HF meals. Our weekly box regularly arrives without ingredient cards, without ingredients, without some meals(!), with moldy vegetables, late, etc. When it was every once in a while I could handle it because I only had to contact support a couple of times a year. But since the new year, I have had to contact support 6 times. I told myself that if our next box arrived with any issues, I would cancel. Well what do you know, opened up our box for this week and immediately saw only 3 out of the 4 meals that we ordered. Of course they included all 4 recipe cards so I mean they didn't completely fuck it up at least. So I went on the website, reported the meal missing, and then called support and asked them to cancel my subscription.\n\nHere's the kicker: while they acknowledged that the missing meal deserved a refund, they gave the refund in \"Hellofresh Cash\", which can only be used as a credit. And since I'm cancelling my subscription, they just get to keep the money. Granted it's only $22, but it's insane to me that they refused to refund me the value in cash. The support member had the nerve to explain that the $22 will stay as credit so whenever I reactivate my account it will still be there. But how the fuck does that help me when I don't plan on ever using this service again? They've basically just stolen $22 from me. \n\nI've already contacted my bank and disputed the transaction. I've never disputed a transaction before in my life but that support call pissed me off so now I'm gonna claw that $22 back like my life depends on it. It's about the principle. Fuck Hellofresh Cash.",

It's completely free to use and I merely created it because it's useful for me and the meal planning I do.\n\nI'm hoping to gauge interest from this community about whether or not it would be useful if I created this same product for the Hello Fresh recipes too?

I scanned and completed my first order. I went to update the second order and saw no discount. I used the chat to ask about the lack of discount and got the run around and \"lucky for you, you received free shipping on your first order and can still receive the knife.\" I asked them to check the code I received, and they said sorry a different code was entered and since I already used it, I was not eligible.   \n  \nWhen I asked they could switch the promo code since that what was clearly stated on the flyer, they said no. So I asked to cancel which they did without trying to keep me as a customer. \n\nThe last delivery service I was using, Blue Apron, started to have a lot of issues, so I thought I'd try this with the promo code. Disappointing that they didn't try to correct the bait and switch. \n\nNot sure if it's allowed to include the promo I received, but I've attached a photo to clearly show the offer and promo code which was ultimately changed on their end without my knowledge. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfurqk151ikg1.jpg?width=2967&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48814601fc20e9c76fa8881dc98275572a1cd552\n\n",

I can\u2019t be bothered sending this feedback to them because it won\u2019t do anything so I\u2019m posting here. \n\nI signed up to Hellofresh on Sunday for the first time to try it out. Entering a bank card just to make an account was a red flag but I went for it anyway. As soon as my account was made, my first box was ordered automatically and \u00a337 was charged to my card. This annoyed me greatly so I went to cancel the whole thing. Turns out I couldn\u2019t as I was \u201cpast the deadline\u201d even though there was no mention of what the deadline was, and despite the fact that I had literally \u201cordered\u201d the box moments before. I could though, apparently, cancel my \u201csubscription\u201d. Despite this, my card cannot be removed from their website, unless I delete the entire account, which is also seemingly very hard to work out how to do.\n\nSeriously shit experience and i hope this post puts others off from bothering trying Hellofresh.",

      "title": "New to HF - Crispy-Skin Salmon and Hunter's Chicken",
      "selftext": "Hi, I recently received my first order of 3 meals from Hello Fresh. Mine arrived well packaged, on time and with nice fresh-seeming food. Do they send their best on first orders? I'm reading so much here about people getting incomplete and late orders or rotten food...were they trying to make a good first impression or did I get lucky?\n\nSaturday, my elderly mother and I made the Crispy-Skin Salmon & Thai Chili Slaw. It took us about 45 minutes to make because we are disorganized and my mom has a little dementia. We got 3 portions out of the meal and both enjoyed it. My mom said she wasn't eating salmon skin, but I made her take a taste and she was surprised to like it. In the instructions, I would have preferred a measurement other than \"large drizzle\" for the salad dressing. A drizzle is okay as an instruction for the amount of oil to cook the fish in, but my mom got a little carried away with her large drizzle for the dressing and I had to do some fixing. I prefer teaspoon or tablespoon when it's for something that matters. The slaw was even better on day 2 when I ate the leftovers.\n\nToday, I made Hunter's Chicken with Creamy Mushroom Sauce, with roasted potatoes & broccoli. I thought the meal was delicious and certainly easy to make. I had some butternut squash to use up so I roasted that, too, and made 3 servings out of the meal again. Without the squash, it would have been 2 servings and I might have wanted a little bit more potato. I do sometimes make a similar recipe of mine (with pasta not potatoes), but without the paprika, but next time I make my own recipe again, I'm definitely adding paprika to it.\n\nI also ordered Vegan Turkish-Spiced Chickpea Bowls, but haven't made it yet. I think the ingredients will last to Wednesday/Friday when Lent starts and I'll be looking for vegetarian meals.\n\nMy first impression is very favorable and I am looking forward to next week's order. I enjoyed the generous portions, especially of vegetables. I liked that while not certified GF, I can order meals with no gluten ingredients. And I like to cook, but I'm usually cooking for 1 so the prepackaged portions are helpful to avoid waste. Typically, I am a one-pot recipe person so this does make more dirty dishes than I am accustomed to.",

WTF? Either they\u2019re good for 2 weeks and have never delivered them as such before (ever) or they\u2019re only good for 1 week and they erred in stamping a 2+ week expiration date. But the worst part is that corporate denied it. Tried to tell me it\u2019s not possible. And tried to tell me that 1 ice is fine \u201cif they felt cold\u201d \u2026 \u201cif they felt cold\u201d is the litmus test between food poisoning and not \u2026 ?\n\n\\- They broke the bottom most two meals in my box of 10 meals. While chatting, I needed to tell them precisely which two meals broke. I told them I didn\u2019t know. They said they couldn\u2019t help me. I eventually listed two random meals in my fridge and they didn\u2019t believe me because I previously said I didn\u2019t know. WTF.\n\n\\- Spent 1 hour and 21 minutes on a chat with these idiots \u2026 after getting disconnected twice because they told me to wait and they would get back to me in 2 minutes. 2 minutes is how long it takes to time out and disconnect you from the chat. MF\u2019ers. So I sent a \u201c.\u201d every minute going forward - the moment the time changed, I sent a \u201c.\u201d And I didn\u2019t disconnect again.\n\n\\- They wound up giving me a refund for 1 week of food.\n\n\\- So glad I won\u2019t endure any more Factor drama. Life\u2019s been busy for us \u2014 we forgot to order meals for the last several weeks and they sent us random meals that my wife wouldn\u2019t eat. Some sucked. Some were good. But at least there won\u2019t be any more drama. We\u2019re back to cooking until we find a more local food delivery service. Just happy we\u2019re not dealing with their crap anymore. \n\n\\- Ironically, I was supposed to get an email from Factor stating that my subscription was canceled \u2014 surprise \u2014 it never came.\n\n\\- And when my chat session ended, there was no option to save the chat \u2014 the transcript was immediately gone when the chat ended. Pretty shitty. No record of my 1 hour and 21 minute chat session.\n\n\\- Yes. So glad I won\u2019t endure any more Factor drama. Good luck folks.",

      "selftext": "Some might remember that I got a Factor bacon chicken dinner with no veggies, 2 cups of sauce, and then it lit on fire in my microwave. True story.\n\nThe next week, the cold pack from the delivery leaked and left a permanent etching on my marble entryway. And several acted like it was somehow my fault that it happened, lol. \"Oh gee, you should throw the box out \\*immediately\\* because it might leak if you leave it for a day. Everyone knows that these ice packs leak caustic liquid that etches marble!\" Well, no I didn't know they leak, and I would assume it wasn't a caustic material if they did.\n\nAnyway, someone from Factor contacted me and said there would be a credit on my account. Visited my account, but there's no credit. I had skipped the week, so there was a message that if I unskipped I'd get receive half off. Nope, that didn't happen either when I unskipped it.\n\nI was told to reach out to customer service regarding the marble situation. Haven't done that yet, but I will likely do so soon. Thinking about ordering a marble restoration kit and trying to see if I can do it myself.\n\nAm I missing something?",

      "title": "Fuel Meals review and overall thoughts on ReadyMeals",
      "selftext": "So I just finished my first order of Fuel Meals, and let me just say\u2026 This shit was absolutely vile.\n\nThis is the fourth nationwide, frozen, ship-to-your-door ready meal company I\u2019ve tried, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s my last. At this point I genuinely believe that meals shipped nationwide and frozen are just never going to taste fresh or high quality. It\u2019s not even about the brand anymore, it\u2019s honestly just the business model. You can\u2019t deep-freeze food, ship it across the country, microwave it, and expect it to taste like something freshly made.\n\nMy recent Fuel Meals order was honestly disgusting. I ordered a bunch of the \u201cfan favorites\u201d thinking that was the safe move, and to honestly no surprise, Almost everything was borderline inedible.\n\nIf I have to give them a tiny win, the buffalo chicken mac & cheese and really anything mac & cheese based was fine. And that\u2019s mostly because mac & cheese is probably the easiest thing on earth to freeze and reheat without completely ruining it. Everything else was rough, The rice meals were dry and clumpy. The protein-heavy plates were rubbery with a weird texture. The potato meals somehow managed to be mushy and dry at the same time.\n\nThe crazy part is, as bad as Fuel was, it honestly wasn\u2019t much worse than the other big nationwide players I\u2019ve tried. Factor wasn\u2019t much better. Clean Eatz Kitchen was okay at best. And FlexProMeals\u2026. Ifykyk.\n\nAt this point I\u2019ve realized you\u2019re just not going to get real quality from these companies no matter how cheap or expensive they are. They\u2019re just not going to hit. The frozen, mass-produced, nationwide shipping model sacrifices too much.\n\nIf you live in a major city, your best bet is finding a locally sourced, locally cooked meal prep company. Delivery or pickup, doesn\u2019t matter. The quality difference is night and day. The food actually tastes fresh and it\u2019s pretty much half the price of the frozen ready shipped.\n\nI live in a pretty big urban city and I already had a local company I used before experimenting with these big brands. Shopping around with the nationwide frozen companies honestly felt like punishment. Frankly, I don\u2019t know why I switched lol. I suppose on the bright side it made me realize how much better the local mealprep companies are. If you can find a A La Carte one where you can order in bulk, by god Do Not Look Back.",
