I signed up again- to find out that they\u2019re now using Dashlink (DoorDash) to deliver boxes. \n\nI\u2019ve only gotten 6 boxes and 3 of them were not delivered.\n\nThe first one, the driver supposedly said it was undeliverable- which is not true becuase I literally get door dash all the time- Dashlink said it was going back to the center. I contacted hello fresh and they told me that actually it was going to be redelivered that day. Guess what? No one came to redeliver it. There\u2019s no tracking available and the small little bit of info on Dashlink just said \u201cundeliverable\u201d. Hello fresh basically told me it\u2019s out their hands and they can\u2019t do anything about it. Dash link doesn\u2019t have customer service and DoorDash won\u2019t help with Dashlink \n\n\nThe next 2 boxes were delivered fine\n\n\nSecond time, the Dashlink driver brought it to the wrong building, even after I contacted the driver and gave specific instructions- and really my building isn\u2019t hard to find. It has 3 massive awning with the building number in it. Anyways, I couldn\u2019t find it for two days becuase it was 6 buildings away. By then it was frozen solid. \n\n\nThird one got delivered an hour before I got home, and then when I got home it was gone. A neighbor actually talked to me and told me she saw The Dashlink driver take the box back after taking a picture \n\n\nSo- yeah. Sadly I\u2019m not going to use hello fresh anymore \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd72",

      "title": "Vegetarian meal kit recommendations?",
      "selftext": "I'm pretty burnt out on the question of \"what's for dinner?\" Lately I've been getting takeout far too often; it is both expensive and not that healthy. I've done meal kits in the past and they were fine for a while, but always had some sort of issue and I stopped.\n\nFor context: I'm in the northeast US and it's just my husband and I eating. We are both vegetarians. I've been a vegetarian for 30 years and prefer more \"veggie\" type dishes, he is a more recent convert and likes fake meats (but will happily eat tofu if prepared so it is not too soft). I currently do most of the cooking, but in the past he has been more willing to cook from a meal kit because everything is explained step by step - he is not a confidant cook.\n\nWhat I am looking for:\n\n* Meal kit of raw ingredients. I don't have a microwave, so single serving heat-n-eat isn't useful.\n* Lots of vegetarian options with protein. When I've had kits from omni companies like Blue Apron I've found their veg options to be very limited, or just the omni meal minus the chicken for the same price.\n* Very clear directions so my husband can cook without asking me how to do anything.\n* Moderately priced. This is probably the area where I am going to have to be the most flexible.\n* Organic ingredients would be great, but this will affect price and availability, so it is not a requirement.\n\nWhat I have tried before:\n\n* Blue Apron - as I said above, their veg options were very limited and lacked protein. But their instructions were good.\n* Purple Carrot - I tried them over 10 year ago and their recipes were a bit to \"hippy\" for my husband. But they seem to have changed a lot over the years so this is a strong contender.\n* Hungry Root - expensive, the ingredients aren't pre-portioned, and the veggies spoil within a day of delivery. The instructions are also very minimal. I won't be going back to them.\n* Imperfect Foods/ Misfit market - not a meal kit. I found them to be more expensive than Whole Foods so I don't use them anymore.\n* Thrive Market - also not a meal kit, but I do get many pantry staples from them.\n* Shaw's supermarket - not really a meal kit, but they have recipes on their website and will build a grocery list based on them so you can meal prep on your own. I find the meals uninspired and rarely use this feature.\n* Mosaic Foods - these are single serving frozen heat-n-eat, although they do have some family sized dishes that can be cooked in the oven. I heated them up on the stovetop and I liked them. But my husband did not like any of the meals and they are a lot of work to prepare without a microwave. The family meal options aren't interesting enough to justify the cost.\n\nSo, does anyone have any recent experience with Purple Carrot? Are there any new services out there that you'd recommend?",

I saw the posts about the crushed/destroyed trays last month. I had three consecutive deliveries contain at least 2-3 crushed meals in November last year. Now, in this week's delivery, the Herb Gravy Grilled Pork Chop is literally rare. This is disgusting and not acceptable at the price point of these meals. I think this is the tipping point for me because like a lot of you guys, I rely on these meals to get me through my work day. Factor customer service gave me a $14 credit which is BS because I don't want anymore Factor Meals, I want my money back. Thanks for the $14 Factor credit I guess, but what am I supposed to eat for lunch now???",

      "selftext": "After being a customer of Hello Fresh I decided to try Factor to save some time cooking during a busy school season. The meals are just ok and are very small portions. To be honest I would generally eat the meat side of the dish as the vegetables sucked. Be aware of the price you are paying..4 meals averaged $18 a piece with shipping and it's simply not worth it. The final straw was that during New Year's holiday I decided to skip a week. When I did this window popped up and gave me a link to an offer that if I unskipped it I would have that week for 50% off. So I did. It did not automatically credit my account so I had to contact customer service. I spend over an hour going back and forth with them and they refused to honor the discount. I even took a screen shot of the discount and they did nothing but give one excuse after another and even lied. A person should not lose an hour of their life over something as cut and dry that should have taken no more than 2 minutes. I closed my account after that....the customer service had the nerve to even ask me why! Stay away from this food service!",

I\u2019ve tried a few, but didn\u2019t like them\u2014either because of the food itself or because the price wasn\u2019t worth it after the initial discount.\nThe one I disliked the most was Factor75 My coworker and I tried it together, and we both thought the food was bland and hard to eat especially the meat. The cost definitely wasn\u2019t worth it. I did HelloFresh for about a month, and it was okay, but I didn\u2019t like the meal options. I had the same issue with Home Chef I didn\u2019t care for the food and didn\u2019t find it worth the price.\nI have a hard time starting to eat clean, but once I stick with it for a week or two, I don\u2019t have a problem continuing. I\u2019ve done keto before and lost the most weight on it, but I felt like I was eating the same meals every week, just in a different order.\nI\u2019ve read good things about Sunbasket and CookUnity, so I\u2019m open to suggestions.

      "title": "CookUnity Review",
      "selftext": "Tried cookunity for my first meal delivery service, I decided I\u2019d give a review for anyone looking to try them.\n\nA little background, I\u2019m 20 and normally I just order DoorDash or pickup food to eat, I was averaging about $15-$20 a day on food and was looking for a cheaper option for food without having to cook daily \n\nMy main worries were taste and portion sizes, I\u2019m aware that a lot of meal delivery services like factor give pretty small portions and I\u2019m a guy who likes to eat a lot so my main concern was getting small portion sizes\n\n\nPricing\nFor the first week I got 60% off and I felt like it was a pretty good deal, I got 16 meals for $105 including delivery and a dessert. This lasted me exactly a week and is less than what I\u2019d spend eating out.\n\nHowever their regular pricing (about 12.50 a meal) seems like it\u2019d be more than what I\u2019d spend a week eating out so it\u2019s definitely not the most price conservative service\n\n\n\nChoices\nTheir meal selection was great with options like steaks, salmon, chicken etc and I felt like I had no issue finding meals that I think I\u2019d like and also trying new flavors that I wouldn\u2019t normally order. They have options for people who are looking out for their health or just for people looking for good tasting meals\n\n\n\nMacros\nI didn\u2019t pay too much attention to the macros because I\u2019m not a super health conscious person but overall they seemed to provide decently healthy meals all around and I every meal came with some side like rice or vegetables which didn\u2019t seem off or old. \n\n\nPortions\nTheir portions were pretty good sizing. I didn\u2019t find myself hungry throughout the day and I ate each meal to completion. I did have to eat 2 meals per day to stay full which seems reasonable for a normal person. I do wish they provided more side portions like extra rice or potatoes but overall it held me off until my next meal. Some meals definitely were less filling or had less meat than others. I\u2019d recommend looking for higher calorie meals if ur looking for bigger portions. The chicken meals specifically seemed to be lacking in portion sizes but the steak and salmon ones gave me basically a full steak or piece of salmon, similar to what I\u2019d get a restaurant or eating out\n\n\nTaste/ preparation \nAll the meals tasted great, I liked some more than others, and I\u2019d say my favorite was the Korean doep bowl. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of some of the sauces but I\u2019m glad they came on the side so u have the option to use them or not. Like I mentioned the vegetables seemed fresh and I didn\u2019t notice any off flavors or textures. The meals did taste like they were from a restaurant and I wasn\u2019t getting any sort of frozen meal vibes from them. I put most of my meals in the oven for around 15-20 mins and they seemed to come out nice. It\u2019s definitely better than the microwave for certain meals, specifically ones that have breading or green beans/asparagus and potatoes.\n\n\nDelivery\nDelivery arrived on time with no issues, and everything was cold when it arrived. I like the reusable insulated bag which normally would cost 3-5$ itself at a grocery store\n\n\n\nOverall I\u2019m very happy with the way things turned out, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d use them very often just because my main reason was to save on costs and more deliveries doesn\u2019t seem to do that, but if u can get a good discount they\u2019re definitely a good option and better than factor from what I hear about factors portion sizes.\n",
