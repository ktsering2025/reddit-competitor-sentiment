      "selftext": "I've been subscribed to HelloFresh for over 2 years now, I originally subscribed when they offered the free add-on item for life with any active subscription. Loved all the fresh and delicious meals I've cooked over the years. \n\nLast Christmas, I was gifted a voucher for one free box from a family member (as an aside, it didn't even cover the full box price, only $80 but whatever). I finally redeemed it two weeks ago, and last week I received an email saying my subscription had been cancelled. I immediately logged in and re-activated the subscription, and confirmed there was an active card on file still. My assumption is their system tried redeeming the gift card a second time, saw zero balance, and cancelled the account... But honestly I am unsure how this happened. Their support team offered no answers. I also noticed I no longer get the free add-on item with my weekly box and so I called customer service to report this issue.\n\nAfter multiple calls with their customer service, their best solution for me was offering me 40% off for one box, stating that they no longer offer the free item for life voucher and as such cannot re-activate it on my account. \n\nI am writing this post after a half hour long frustrating call with them where I cancelled my subscription and will be looking elsewhere since they refused to honor their own mistake. \n\nIf you plan on redeeming any sort of gift voucher code, please double check your account the following week or share the same situation I find myself in.",

Basically, they explained but didn\u2019t bore. It felt like \u201ctalking to a friend who cooks more than you.\u201d\n\nWe tried something similar for a food client.\n\nVersion A: classic FAQ script, lots of brand lines.  \nVersion B: same info but rephrased like a comment reply (\u201ceveryone keeps asking what this is, so here\u2019s the deal\u2026\u201d).\n\nB pulled +23% higher watch time and +12% CTR.\n\nThe comment-style hook gave it that native feel, while the explainer stayed tight enough to educate.\n\nOur takeaway: FAQ content doesn\u2019t need to be brand talking to camera.   \nIt works when it sounds like an answer inside the feed, not an ad dropped into it.\n\nAnyone else tested FAQ or \u201canswer format\u201d creatives lately?

      "title": "Put down my 19 year old beloved cat or hospitalization?",
      "selftext": "Species: Cat\n\nAge: 19\n\nSex/Neuter status: male, neutered\n\nBreed: Domestic shorthair (orange tabby)\n\nBody weight: 5.6 lbs\n\nHistory: Kidney disease, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, anemia. Two bouts of pancreatitis, last time a year ago, which he recovered from.\n\nCoco is lovable and active and loves human attention. He's struggled with all of those issues for years, but we've gotten around his hatred for the renal diet food by constantly switching up the food brands and types, feeding him whenever he asks for it (frequently, little bits at a time), giving him Greeny's treats, and by giving him wet and dry food.\n\nOver the past two weeks, his energy has dropped considerably. He's still eating, but it's less than before. He's not hiding. He's not defecating well - sometimes outside of the box, and not for the past 3 days. He continues to urinate normally. We brought him to the vet, and this is what they said:\n\n\"I wanted to update you on Coco\u2019s recent lab results. Compared to the previous testing from April, there has been a marked progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both his BUN and creatinine are significantly higher (BUN increased from 53 mg/dL to 133 mg/dL; creatinine increased from 4.1 mg/dL to 7.4 mg/dL).\n\nIn addition, Coco's phosphorus level is also now elevated (increased from 5.8 mg/dL to 8.4 mg/dL), which also reflects worsening kidney function and reduced ability to clear waste products.\n\nThe CBC panel is still pending, which will help determine whether Coco is developing anemia secondary to CKD or if there could be another cause contributing to the decline. (UPDATE - he is anemic)\n\nThat being said, this degree of elevation is concerning enough that I would strongly recommend short-term hospitalization for supportive care and further evaluation. We briefly discussed that this would allow for intravenous fluids to help flush the kidneys and also the ability to perform additional diagnostics to assess for any factors contributing to the progression such as blood pressure, urine protein loss, or other metabolic changes. Both of which I would recommend.\n\nIf this is not something you think you would like to pursue for Coco, then unfortunately I would reflect more on the end of our conversation yesterday. As I can tell you that with these changes on blood work, Coco's quality of life and long-term prognosis appear very poor at this stage.\n\nI understand that Coco has not been tolerating the prescription renal diet well. And as we discussed, in these cases, the priority is to ensure adequate calorie intake, even if that means feeding a preferred food. I would considering utilizing a phosphate binder to help control Coco's phosphorus levels at this time. I typically recommend trialing Aluminum hydroxide gel or powder. These products bind dietary phosphorus in the intestinal tract, reducing absorption and helping to slow further kidney damage.\"\n\nI spoke with the vet directly, and she recommended that we put him down. She said that hospitalization would be stressful, and while they could flush his kidneys, him being 19 and at such an advanced stage of kidney failure means that it wouldn't be a reprieve for long.\n\nI've never been in this position before, this is my first pet. I understand and respect what she's saying, but before I actually put him down I wanted to get a second opinion here. As he's at the end, we gave him chicken and tuna tonight, and he ate a LOT (more than I can remember). He's actually perking up and engaged right now, and it's hard to reconcile that with how he's appearing right now. The vet also said something I agree with - it's so much better for him to be put down on a good day so he's comfortable. But if we hospitalize him for a few days to flush his kidneys, especially considering that he still has an appetite and has the capacity for being peppy, could he have another 6+ months of comfortable life? Could the IV fluids make that much of a difference if he's still engaged and hungry? Two weeks ago he was normal for \"older\" Coco.\n\nClinical signs: reduced appetite (unless he's eating straight tuna or chicken, he hates the renal diet food), weight loss, strained walking, sleeping a lot, reduced energy, defecating outside litter box, constipation, confusion, unbalanced/unsteady on his feet, some twitching\n\nDuration: everything except for anemia - 4 years, has been doing well on the treatment (amlodipine and felimazole with the renal food)\n\nYour general location: NYC\n\nThanks so much for the help.",

      "title": "A Not-So-Miracle but a Major Shift: What the Latest GLP-1 Data Means for Obesity Care",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone! Dr. Vijai Chandra here, co-founder of Joult Health. I wanted to share some thoughts on a [recent article by NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate) that caught my eye: according to a report via Gallup, the U.S. adult obesity rate has dipped to 37 percent, down from nearly 40 percent just a few years ago.\u00a0\n\n  \nThat decline happens to line up with a large uptick in use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (the drugs behind brands like Ozempic, Zepbound etc) for weight management.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to talk about how I\u2019m interpreting these numbers, how Joult Health is placing itself in the mix, and what I think matters as we move forward.\n\n# What the data shows:\n\n* The obesity rate of 37 percent is meaningful because for decades the U.S. obesity number was stuck, or creeping upward.\n* The usage of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has more than doubled recently, from about 5.8 percent in early 2024 to 12.4 percent in surveys.\n* The decline in obesity appears stronger among the 40-64 age group \u2014 the group where uptake of GLP-1s is highest.\u00a0\n\n# What this means and why I\u2019m cautiously optimistic:\n\nAt Joult Health, our mission is to reduce obesity and chronic health conditions by giving people access to medical tests, data insights, and when eligible, GLP-1 medications. What these recent numbers suggest is that\u00a0**the physiology of obesity is being addressed in a meaningful way**\u00a0\u2014 not just via diet/exercise alone but via pharmacology\u00a0*plus*\u00a0data-driven support.\n\nHere\u2019s what I like:\n\n* We\u2019re moving toward treating obesity like the complex metabolic condition it is \u2014 not just \u201ceat less, move more.\u201d The brain, hormones, metabolism all matter.\n* The fact that a measurable drop in obesity coincides with wider GLP-1 use hints that these medications may be shifting the baseline of what \u201cnormal\u201d weight looks like for many people.\n* For our model at Joult, the data-first approach (tracking labs, measuring metabolic biomarkers, monitoring progress) becomes even more relevant: medication helps, but without monitoring you lose insight and risk inefficient or unsafe care.\n\n# But, and yes there\u2019s a but. (no pun intended!)\n\nI remain cautious for several reasons:\n\n* **Correlation is not causation.** Just because obesity rates dropped while GLP-1 use climbed doesn\u2019t mean the drugs alone are responsible. Other changes (diet culture shifts, public health programs, etc) might play roles.\n* **Access remains unequal.** These drugs tend to be used by those who can get them (age, insurance status, cost factors) which means the benefit may not reach everyone equally.\n* **Long-term outcomes matter.** Weight loss is useful, but what we care most about is reducing cardiovascular risk, improving metabolic health, improving quality of life \u2014 not just hitting a number on the scale.\n* **Sustainability is a question.** If people stop the medication or no longer adhere, weight regain is a risk. Stopping the drug doesn\u2019t always mean the metabolic shift remains.\n\nHere\u2019s how we think about it at Joult Health:\n\n1. **Baseline testing.**\u00a0Before starting any medication (including GLP-1s) we do metabolic panels, hormone checks, body composition measurements, and get the \u201clay of the land.\u201d\n2. **Eligibility & guided use.**\u00a0Not everyone is a candidate for GLP-1s. We screen for underlying conditions, contraindications, and ensure patients understand what the medication can\u00a0*and cannot*\u00a0do.\n3. **Lifestyle integration.**\u00a0Medication is not a standalone fix \u2014 we integrate dietary guidance, physical activity planning, stress & sleep optimization. The medication opens a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d and you fill it with good habits.\n4. **Data monitoring and adaptation.**\u00a0We track labs, metrics, subjective feedback (e.g., \u201cfood noise\u201d, cravings, mood) and adjust protocols. This is part of the \u201cdata-first\u201d promise.\n5. **Equity lens.**\u00a0We are trying to make access broader and transparent. The more people who can benefit safely, the more the population effect improves.\n\n# My take-home message:\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this and thinking:\u00a0*\u201cIs this miracle time for obesity?\u201d*, I\u2019d say yes\u2026 but\u00a0*with caveats*. We\u2019re seeing real progress. The drop to 37 percent is a signal that this class of drugs plus system changes\u00a0**might**\u00a0be shifting the curve. But we\u2019re still early days. It\u2019s not a silver bullet. It\u2019s a powerful tool.\n\nIf you are considering taking action (whether via Joult or another provider), ask these questions:\n\n* **Are you being assessed properly** (labs, baseline, overall health)?\n* Are you clear on what the medication\u00a0*can*\u00a0do and what it\u00a0*can\u2019t*?\n* Do you have a support system (nutrition/exercise/sleep/stress) to make the most of the intervention?\n* Are you clear on monitoring, side-effects, cost, long-term plan?\n\nWould love to hear from you, especially if you\u2019ve used or considered GLP-1s, or if you\u2019re working in obesity/chronic care management. What\u2019s your experience? What worries you? What excites you?",

      "title": "Novel Uncoated Non Stick Surfaces",
      "selftext": "Because of some Discussions about Misen, I wanted to gather some facts about available uncoated  nonstick surfaces.\n\nSeasoning hardened steel pans: About seasoning - it's best not to let mess build up in any of these pans. Simple nitrided are most tolerant to this, the more advanced the construction the less tolerant they are. This also means - for a wok don't use any of the very advanced pans - it will be a mess to keep them clean when you stir fry on very high temperature. Right now no one here in Taiwan recommends them for high heat. This shows as well in the format of those pans - even the round ones are usually max 10cm high - meaning unsuitable as a wok. E.g. the ASD 34cm round bottom has only 6l volume. The manufacturer know that this kind of surface is not suitable to very high heat cooking! Later I will explain why!\n\n# Cleaning\n\nHow to clean them if messed up and neither dishwasher nor soap helps. First just try something abrasive like steel wool/barkeepers friend or a salt/water paste and a kitchen sponge. In the ASD 0-Ti or the Corelle Duranano (plus clones) I would even go in with sandpaper (not diamond coated of course!) if steelwool isn't enough - in others which don't have a specified hardness - don't use sandpaper. Then you can try to use heat to burn it off (heat up the empty pan to 500\u00b0 Celsius slowly - or put it into your oven with the self cleaning program after taking the handle off if possible.\n\nWhy is it essential to clean them very well? That is because the surface of some of those pans on a nano level is actually quite porous for the oil to attach. It varies by type how porous. ASD publishes a picture where you can see big proes than can be penetrated by oil. Now those pores need to be empty for fresh oil to stick to it while cooking and give you a non stick surface. On Corelle Duranano I rather believe this is not the case and the pan by itself is pretty nonstick - it has a very different feeling to it. While the ASD is pretty blunt, the Corelle is rather glass like. Out of the box with a finger the Corelle feels super smooth but not even. The ASD is blunt and feels a bit like sandpaper. So maybe the Corelle is fine with very high heat - still the fact that also Corelle doesn't produce a real wok shape makes this pretty unlikely!\n\nBest throw them into the dishwasher after cooking every 5-10 times at least. Applies to all the new generation pans.\n\n# Hardness\n\nHow hard are those pans? I took my keys and tried to scratch them full power. On the ASD the key leaves a trail and it looks like you scratched it. Then you take your finger wipe over it and you see that it actually filed down your keys! On the Corelle however the key just slides over and leaves no trace. Now don't try this with super hard steel - if you take a hard steel file from Vallorbe - it will mess up your pan. Normal files are 56-60HRC so a tad softer than the pan, Hard Steel files by Vallorbe however are 72HRC and that will certainly cut right into your pan with it teeth.\n\nThere are two good guides for treating them if they get sticky. As all those pans behave a bit similar, the seasoning will work similar too. High heat seasoning is NOT useful. This one by Corelle [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=390920150553782](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=390920150553782)\n\nOr by Zhongkang for their third generation deep nitrided steel: Heat up the pan to low-mid heat, then apply thin layer of oil with paper towel, then continue heating for 5-10 minutes. Then wash with hand and dishwashing liquid...\n\n# --- Simply hardened steel Pans ---\n\nThe oldest method - around since at least 5-6 years is simple gas nitriding of low carbon steel. The problem is - this doesn't penetrate the surface deeply - and it's pretty hard to consider this nonstick. It is definitely less sticky than normal low carbon steel and prevents rust pretty well - but it isn't very hard either. 300-400 HV (OV) is typical. A premium example of nitrided low carbon steel pans is Summit - maybe they actually improved on it? This type of pan is still fully suitable for high heat cooking. You should however still make sure to clean it well with soap after each use. Air drying is good enough to prevent rust. Keeping them standing around for days with water inside is not wise. I would cound Analon N2 into this group. Yeah they call it non stick but it really doesn't compete here. I would also count in Strata here. And maybe give Hestan Nanobond a shot in the same category? Or should the Nanobond be actually non stick - the reports are very opposing.\n\n# --- Uncoated hardened steel non stick pans ---\n\nFirst of all - Note that electroplating is not a coating depending on whom you ask. Some still consider it a coating. Both ASD and Corelle show they electroplated/electrolyed a Titanium Oxide/Zirconium as a full layer to the cooking surface - however it's a bit dubious how thick this layer is and if it's more marketing or actually changing the underlying pan a lot. For a long time there was the opinion that you cannot harden stainless steel. However that only applied to gas nitriding which is not possible. There are several scientific papers showing that you can also harden basically any stainless steel. The most common is electrolytic plasma hardening. [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00204-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00204-w) and [https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/5/872](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/5/872)\n\nHowever an even harder and thicker coating could be achieved by other means (and this would not be considered a coating but a plating by some definitions: [https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/18/6718](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/18/6718)\n\n# Corelle Duranano (and Schulte Ufer)\n\nCorelle Duranano (and it's sibbling Schulte Ufer Astral) The very first commercially available non stick uncoated pan was the Corelle Duranano. That pan is quite a suprise when you hold it in your hand first. It's very light feeling and the finishing is top notch. If you look at it, it looks pretty expensive. The surface is shining in the light a bit and has a very smooth touch - though it's not flat. We don't want a flat surface in a nonstick pan. Standard stainless steel is very flat - that's one of the reasons why food loves to stick to it. [https://corelleasia.com/pages/corelle-duranano](https://corelleasia.com/pages/corelle-duranano) This page has some videos and shows the pan as it really looks. The cooking examples look also like I'm used to from a Schulte Ufer Astral Universus - which IMHO is produced by Corelle/or the same factory. At least new it's way more non stick vs Misen. The only AI/computer generated video is obvious (Duranano 3d features). I've held both in my hand already but hadn't had a chance to cook.\n\nNow in some chinese adverts they claim electrolytic steel hardening - hence I would hope for the process linked above reaching 1100 HV.\n\nThe reports are a bit similar to Misen, don't use it for high heat or it becomes sticky. You can clean it as written in the beginning and reseason it.\n\nIt's pretty obvious Schulte Ufer lacks knowledge about what they sell as they are just reselling, similar to Misen. Corelle is the originial here. Also while the Schulte Ufer looked very similar to me - it feels cheaper and the surface isn't as smooth. Without cooking on either of them it feels like a price reduced version.\n\nCould it be that they are produced by ASD. Yes it's not unlikely at all. The 1.5M abrasion resistant first appeared on some older ASD pfas nonstick pans. It's the highest abrasion resistance class that they have an official test for in China. I guess this Nano whatever treatment plated on top is similar, but the surface below is pretty different or treated/hardened very differently.\n\n# ASD 0-Ti\n\nASD is the worlds biggest producer of nonstick cookware. Likely the biggest OEM of pans / skillets overall though Groupe SEB (Tefal/Tfal) may claim that title. But they are Chinese so don't expect a proper website - they publish most info on Chinese tiktok/taobao - useless to link here as links aren't usable outside China/without taobao account.\n\nHowever it's Taiwanese reseller or is it actually their own Taiwanese department has quite some useful info:\n\n[https://asdtw.com/product/asd%e9%88%a6%e6%99%b60%e5%a1%97%e5%b1%a4%e4%b8%8d%e6%b2%be%e7%82%92%e9%8d%8b32cm/](https://asdtw.com/product/asd%e9%88%a6%e6%99%b60%e5%a1%97%e5%b1%a4%e4%b8%8d%e6%b2%be%e7%82%92%e9%8d%8b32cm/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRlHZg4Cvmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRlHZg4Cvmo)\n\nTheir youtube channel - it's mostly interesting to see what they use the 0-ti for - all low - medium heat while high heat is reserved to other pans\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%84%9B%E4%BB%95%E9%81%94](https://www.youtube.com/@%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%84%9B%E4%BB%95%E9%81%94)\n\nAs written above it's very different from the Corelle Duranano but looks very similar to Misen. I'm therefore pretty sure it's actually nitrided carbon steel and NOT stainless steel. On top of that they use a Titanium Oxide plating - a bit similar to Corelle. The surface is really hard and abrasive to metal. As you can see whatever kitchenware metal you scrape over it - gets abraded.\n\nI've attached a couple of pics I took of the pan to this post - what looks like scratches is just lose metal from the utensils/people trying to destroy the pan in the shop because the salespeople encourage you to try!\n\nNow ASD themselves doesn't say how they hardened it. A reseller Heapseng claimed in a video it's plasma nitrided low carbon steel. Make of it what you want. Unlike Corelle were left a bit more in the dust.\n\nLook at an AI closeup I found of the surface - it's really interesting! It shows how oil attaches to a very porous surface. Now if those pores get dirty the pan is toast until you manage to clean them up again. Also this pic only shows 3 layers - that whatever titanium dioxide layer is missing.  Now this actually looks a bit like those roughened up hardened stainless steels. And it explains perfectly why once there is actual proper seasoning it's not non stick anymore. The oil needs those pores to attach and form a very thin film. Any of those pans isn't super flat, they all need a texture or pores.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0h0iyty7vxf1.jpg?width=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46e5a226a09090f73592d2e4cb8e4a636a8ba03\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cookware/comments/1o29yhv/asd\\_0ti\\_zero\\_coating\\_non\\_stick\\_most\\_likely\\_same/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cookware/comments/1o29yhv/asd_0ti_zero_coating_non_stick_most_likely_same/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/th0q5cx17vxf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e10f58c0afeda59e9414210ae4da4e91f528263\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9w27fex17vxf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=161090d747bdb7453071c45c4146ab2d6e190f29\n\nYep looks scratched as hell but is just keys or whatever people used in the store to abuse the pan and goes away simply by swiping your finger above\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1u9edx17vxf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=357e792c831b6e8e629bfe030314d0d508572a49\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc2ffwx17vxf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9db73716e9b4032ce178dd3321d9bef30e8b2611\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7c0xdvx17vxf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66642832bdc7a5bc25fbf9953ace4df10e56bf62\n\nCloseup macro shot showing the porous abrasive surface\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5wm6ago9vxf1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6751bff194d52099dec863b0cefa82451062b7d\n\nDoes this surface look similar to you? Jackpot here we go:\n\nStolen from this post for reference: Yep the below picture is the Misen Carbon non Stick not the ASD 0-Ti yet they looks damn identical...\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/carbonsteel/comments/1nc19uu/misen\\_carbon\\_nonstick\\_loose\\_fibers\\_embedded\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/carbonsteel/comments/1nc19uu/misen_carbon_nonstick_loose_fibers_embedded_in/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/optgyk3vcvxf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f501503ebf733a13ac90a2769b4682e40bd96ae\n\n# \u4e2d\u5eb7 Zhongkang - Deeply Nitrided Carbon Steel pans:\n\nSee all info and short cooking experience here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/carbonsteel/comments/1oejaeq/random\\_nitrated\\_carbon\\_steel\\_wok\\_from\\_taobao/](https://www.reddit.com/r/carbonsteel/comments/1oejaeq/random_nitrated_carbon_steel_wok_from_taobao/)\n\nThe manufacturer info is nowhere to be found as so often for Chinese brands (they are mid tier, ASD is the top tier in China): [https://www.rakuten.com.tw/shop/jzzx/product/zhk1gct8h/](https://www.rakuten.com.tw/shop/jzzx/product/zhk1gct8h/)\n\nBut again a taiwanese sales page exists. The interesting bit:\n\n[https://shop.r10s.com/c61/982/235d/c4d8/b5e6/3b5b/4df2/421933a58a5e0eaa32edc7.jpg](https://shop.r10s.com/c61/982/235d/c4d8/b5e6/3b5b/4df2/421933a58a5e0eaa32edc7.jpg)\n\nIt shows as is correct that normal nitriding only goes 5-10 nanometers into the surface. It could actually be damaged and isn't that hard. The here used mid heat 24 hour duration nitriding is penetrating 20-30nanometer and achieving a higher hardness. Though not as hard as the ASD 0-Ti (which clearly is copied in their marketing material) or the Corelle Duranano.\n\nWhile as a non stick pan I would specwise rate it below Corelle and ASD (it's also much cheaper), it should work better for stir frying.\n\n# Misen Carbon Non Stick:\n\nI would rate this clearly lowest of the bunch. Misen clearly has no clue about what their selling else they would not have output such a lot of misinformation like their graph or their it gets better with use rubbish. It looks like they kinda translated ASD 0-Ti marketing material into English while making some mistakes.\n\nTheir simple claim to fame is they were the first to market such a pan in USA - and on reddit. Quality wise I  would rank them at the very bottom of all those non stick uncoated pans. But I haven't held it in my hands.\n\nOh that it's the most expensive of the bunch doesn't make it any better. At best what they sell has identical surface to the ASD 0-Ti. At worst it's just a simple low heat but longer duration nitrided pan which has very good factory preseasoning. The nonstick effect while new doesn't even play in the same leage as Corelle and ASD looks superior in their videos...\n\nAnd as the surface looks so damn identical to the ASD 0-Ti - what about the it's only nitrided nothing else claim. The only nitrided pan the Zhongkang is clearly a very different beast. Yet unlike Corelle, Schulte-Ufer and ASD they don't lose a word about using some electroplating on top of the surface. So either both of these pans have no coating or both do. Much more likely they do have some sort of titanium dioxide electroplating too.\n\nI hate it when you buy something boldly claiming something while just hiding many important facts. I think that's clearly the case for Misen.\n\n# Homsto:\n\n[https://www.homsto.com/Non-stick-Cookware.html](https://www.homsto.com/Non-stick-Cookware.html)\n\nnot sure what they sell  - they clearly got very advanced nitriding - their nitriding furnace looks like a plasma one. No info at all available except their high end nitriding furnace.\n\n# Durability? The big question:\n\nAll those pans claim high hardness values. Sadly there is not much info available with them being very new.\n\n# What will I buy?\n\nI think I will get the Zhongkang 34cm round bottom wok before leaving Taiwan, as well as a Corelle Duranano frying pan in 28cm. I will report back in December how they fare. Why the Duranano over the ASD 0-Ti? Well I will not use it for high heat and the finishing is just way better. Also I want a very reactive pan and I feel it's more reactive. I just trust it holds up an eternity if not used for high heat. It's the only pan out of the bunch to need a little oil and then can cook 4-5 dishes without re-oiling. Throwing salmon in without oil and it doesn't stick. It's as good or better as a new Teflon pan. Also the ASD seems to be optimised for gas with that bottom, it will be poor on it/hallogen and okay on induction. The other pans are more induction optimised. The Schulte Ufer to avoid on gas.\n\nThe Zhongkang  just feels more premium even though I trust ASD a bit more on their surface durability. Also the water repellent effect of the Duranano is just crazy (it's better than a top end (yeah still cheap) Tefal out of the box in the supermarket - I splashed some water on both to compare)\n\nThe safe option - wait it out 3-4 years. By then we will know which concepts works long time and which doesn't. Those pans will arrive in 1-2 years surely in the western world too. So far China is the place to be to get advanced materials - and no these pans are too expensive for Aliexpress without them being known in the west. Only the zhongkang maybe could. But AliExpress with vat and everything usually means more than twice the taobao price, often three times. Right now going through a taobao shipping agent and creating an Alipay account is in Europe/US the only way to get the Corelle, the ASD and the Zhongkang. And then beware of fakes - all those 3 companies are already reporting that there a plenty of fakes out.... It never takes long to visually copy something in China.\n\n# Health concerns \n\nTitanium dioxide actually isn't that safe as once assumed. I read a medical study that about 10% or population somehow metabolizes it. So far when you get a titanium implant in your body this isn't checked yet and those levels must be way higher. Also maybe the biggest problem is that the implant will wear down much faster not that it's a problem for your body but the study was not about that but about the fact that some people metabolize it and further studies are needed. Any titanium that comes in contact with oxygen oxidises and forms titanium dioxide on the surface.",

      "title": "Follow up of why I'm returning my Galaxy XR for productivity+entertainment use",
      "selftext": "A number of you have likely seen my posts on another thread regarding why I'm sending back the Galaxy XR. The use cases I was testing include the following:\n\n* General purpose web browsing and information delivery.\n* Productivity use by acting as a secondary screen for my work laptop and home PC.\n* A private screen for viewing information on my phone screen inside the interface.\n* Media consumption via Netflix, YouTube, and Crunchyroll.\n\nI put in the order on launch day for the device and controllers during the presentation. I was one of the lucky ones to actually get the controllers, though I have not even bothered opening them after my other findings. I will be initiating the return process tomorrow. Knowing what I know now, it feels disingenuous to open the controllers - I'd rather keep them sealed so they can be resold as new to someone who needs them.\n\nHere are the factors that led to my decision:\n\n* While do I find eye tracking to be nearly perfect, the more I've used it the more I'm finding that **hand tracking has bugs** especially detecting the home gesture to open the dashboard.\n* While the displays are good, crisp, and detailed, **the dynamic range of the passthru video feed is awful**.\u00a0 The cameras are sharp enough that I can read my phone screen to take basic actions. But any light source slightly brighter than ambient will clip into a solid block of color, so glancing out my window yields a flat bluish-white sky that looks utterly awful.\n* **The Phone Link function was intentionally misrepresented** in their demonstration and marketing materials and does not allow you to pass your phone screen through to be displayed inside the headset. Instead, it only allows you to see notifications which is not nearly as useful. It's even more concerning that a recent Galaxy fold device on the latest Android update cannot perform a smart view type of screencast into the headset.\n* Similarly **the PC Link functionality only works with the Galaxy branded laptop** which means that it is essentially useless for 99+% of us. \u00a0Even wireless display casting from a Windows 10 or 11 device does not work as the headset does not show up as a destination display.\n* The built in USB port supports ADB debugging and also supports Ethernet over USB functionality apparently, but they bafflingly left out any kind of Displayport Alt mode. This is a baffling omission since it means that any kind of productivity work is immediately not possible without use of third party software like virtual desktop. Even if you are OK with that extreme limitation, you are stuck doing it over either Wi-Fi or a janky USB to Ethernet bridge. But far worse, **on a work laptop where you are not authorized to install or run non standard software, it makes this device completely unusable.**\n* Now, speaking of comfort, the **non-replaceable strap** with no over-the-top head support means that when you look up at sharp angles all of the weight lands on the bridge of your nose and causes extreme discomfort. In fact, I think I hate just about everything about this strap. For example, with the big-ass metal knob on the back, you cannot rest back in bed or in a recliner watching something because it causes discomfort at the back of your head.\n* **Typing and text entry almost makes me contemplate self-harm. It's that bad.** If you want to do voice input, that's borderline acceptable, but you lose any sense of privacy so it's a no-go for me. Given that, you are stuck doing hunt-and-peck typing at the rate of (at best) 1-1.5 characters per second. I was hoping there'd be a keyboard that would allow something approaching touch-typing speed, but nope. Of course, my goal would have been to use this as a PC display and type on my keyboard, but apparently Samsung doesn't really care about productivity workflows even though they imply they do in their presentations.\n\n**Basically way, way too many tradeoffs for a \\~$2000 device.**  There were a few positives that gave me pause though:\n\n* Media consumption for proper horizontal video content is really immersive and nice, and the audio is actually quite decent. Honestly, if it were cheaper, this would possibly be the ultimate video viewing device, provided it had better comfort.\n* The Gemini AI integration is also quite excellent. I did not redeem the Pro AI coupon since I only wanted to use that if I kept it, but I can imagine that would make it even better. But being able to circle-to-search anything in the real world was quite impressive, and then being able to take what search found and go into a voice conversation with Gemini about it really does seem like the future we were promised in the 90s.\n* The ability to have several apps open and be tiled around you like the old Lawnmower Man movie interface was super nice and futuristic, but it's a little annoying when some windows get dimmed when one of the apps is playing video.\n* Battery life is about where they promise, so not great, but not anything unexpected, and if you are sitting near a charger, you can just leave the battery plugged in and have basically unlimited life.",

      "selftext": "Apologies in advance if this subreddit doesn't like this type of inquiry.\n\nI'm currently setting up my first desktop setup (I have no idea how I survived off only laptops for so long) in my college dorm. I wanted to get a microphone for it, with my expected use cases being primarily streaming my audio (for meetings and voice chats) and recording audio (for videos).\n\nSo, I wanted to ask about what sorts of things I should look out for when judging microphones. I've found it's somewhat difficult to get a good grasp on such things without prior experience. Some examples that I could think of are:\n\n* Audio Ranges (what is good? is there a typical range? do I need more?)\n* Audio Quality (what things determine how good a microphone is? I assume sampling rate and such are a factor? how much is reasonable to care about? are there microphones that do noise suppression automatically? is it better to just use software to process captured audio?)\n* XLR (what are the benefits? any downsides? why might I want to use it? or not?)\n* Pricing (how does pricing work, in terms of price to performance? how notable are brand premiums? is it worth paying some brand premiums?)\n* Investment (how much is even reasonable to invest? is just getting some random cheap mic worth it? is it worth getting a slightly better one? or perhaps even getting a better-than-necessary reasonable?)\n\nFor reference, while I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, I have definitely noticed that I'm noticeably more sensitive to sound than most. For example, I prefer silent keyboards and expect to soundproof my living spaces in the future (once I leave the dorm, which I imagine a microphone would live longer than that).",

      "title": "How Long Do Coffee Makers Last?",
      "selftext": "If you love coffee as much as many of us do, knowing how long your coffee maker should last is important before you consider a replacement. The lifespan depends on various factors including the type of coffee maker, how often you use it, your maintenance habits, and its build quality.\n\n**Average Lifespan by Coffee Maker Type**\n\n* **Drip Coffee Makers:** Generally last around 4 to 6 years with average use and proper care. Their simpler mechanics tend to make them more durable with less maintenance.\n* **Espresso Machines:** These vary widely. Manual and semi-automatic espresso machines often last between 7 and 15 years. Fully automatic or super-automatic machines with complex electronics may have a shorter lifespan around 4 to 8 years.\n* **Single-Serve Pod Machines:** Usually last between 3 and 5 years. These tend to have more wear due to their compact, mechanical pod-piercing designs and electronics.\n\n**Key Factors That Influence Coffee Maker Longevity**\n\n* **Frequency of Use:** Machines used multiple times daily will wear faster, but interestingly, machines left unused for long periods can suffer from mechanical and electronic deterioration as well.\n* **Maintenance and Cleaning:** Proper descaling, cleaning of coffee oils, and replacing water filters greatly extend the durability of any coffee maker. Neglecting these can cause buildup, damage heating elements, and impair taste and performance.\n* **Water Quality:** Hard water accelerates scale buildup inside the machine, damaging components. Using filtered or softened water can vastly improve lifespan.\n* **Build Quality and Brand:** While higher-end models usually offer better materials and reliability, a mid-range machine cared for well can outlast a premium model that\u2019s neglected.\n\n**Signs It\u2019s Time to Replace Your Coffee Maker**\n\nLook out for these indicators:\n\n* Inconsistent brewing temperature resulting in weak or burnt coffee.\n* Leaks or pooling water around the machine.\n* Persistent odd noises or grinding sounds.\n* Noticeable change in coffee taste indicating internal damage or residue buildup.\n* Frequent breakdowns or need for repairs that become costly.\n\nYou can get full [overview](https://coffeecomplex.com.au/how-long-do-coffee-machines-last-a-comprehensive-guide/) on coffee machine lifespans. \n\nHow old is your current coffee maker?

      "title": "A candidate retrospective on Stuart Baggs the Brand",
      "selftext": "My first ever Apprentice season that I watched live was series 6, and there was one candidate I loved more than anyone else. Stuart Baggs the Brand. Looking back at his past performances though, along with the criticism he got at the time, I found there to be a massive comparison to be made towards both himself and the Apprentice candidates we get nowadays.\n\nStuart made his mark right out of the gate with two legendary quotes. \"I am Stuart Baggs the Brand\" and \"Everything I touch turns to sold.\" I refuse to believe that production wrote the second one, I just refuse to. In the actual task though, Stuart's main contribution was annoying the hell out of both customers and Jamie. Unsurprisingly, he was brought back into the boardroom for this, where Stuart made some ridiculous promises to Lord Sugar, not to mention that he bragged about being the best salesperson when he wasn't. Having said that, I will never not love this exchange with Dan.\n\n*\"Dan, how many sausages did you make yesterday?\"*\n\n*\"Well what I did was that I managed a team that made\"-*\n\n*\"So that's on a calculator... (taps away on the invisible calculator) naught.\"*\n\nLord Sugar ended up firing Dan, because Dan was utterly dreadful, but even then, Lord Sugar considered firing Stuart. Due to this, Stuart decided to take a quieter role in week 2, not doing a whole lot. In week 3 though, Stuart started to show his selling skills, selling remarkably well on the market stall.\n\nBut then week 4 happened. The task was to select products, and sell them to corporate buyers. Stuart\u2019s team had their eyes on baby clothing that changed colour depending on the baby\u2019s temperature. Stuart had valid concerns and questions, but the way he told them was rather slapdash and unengaging. His pitch to one of the retailers went sour after his demonstration of the product failed, though in fairness to him, that wasn\u2019t his fault.\n\nHe still didn\u2019t end up selling anything though, and was brought back into the boardroom as a result. To his credit, he did behave more professionally than he did in week 1, and since Melissa was in the boardroom with him, he wasn\u2019t in any real danger of going.\n\nStuart didn\u2019t get a lot of attention in week 5, but Paloma was very complimentary of him in the final boardroom, so he probably did sell well. In week 6, the teams were tasked with branding and marketing a bottle of kitchen cleaner. Stuart was very enthusiastic about Chris\u2019 Germonator idea, though in all fairness to the team, the idea itself wasn\u2019t why that team failed, rather the execution of it. And to give Stuart credit, he made the radio advert, which was as good as it could realistically be given the branding.\n\nStuart was finally given the reigns of project manager in week 7, where he was tasked in selling personalised DVDs. Throughout the task, he was highly criticised for his irritating leadership style, particularly by Nick Hewer, and to be honest, I don\u2019t get it. Based on what is shown in the edit, Stuart made very quick decisions without thinking about them carefully enough, forcing him to make swift changes as the day progressed. I can see how that can annoy his teammates, but at least he made the changes before it was too late. He was responsible for sending out faulty DVDs though, that I will put on his doorstep. But overall, it was a solid effort for the Brand.\n\nWeek 8 was definitely Stuart\u2019s best week. The task was to create crisps and sell them to German companies. Stuart knew some German, and used it to help build rapport with the Germans. He played a key role in nailing down the team\u2019s English theming, which went down better than them pretending to be a German brand like the other team did. I was also impressed by how he worked with Laura on the second day, telling her to speak slowly to the Germans (she didn\u2019t but that wasn\u2019t his fault), and keeping calm and levelheaded when his second big pitch was taken from him (unlike Laura who threw a temper tantrum)\n\nWeek 9 was the negotiation round, and he and Chris formed a brilliant comedy double act. Watching them negotiate by coming up with such lame stories was absolutely hilarious, but it was effective. Their prices were over half the opposing team\u2019s in some cases.\n\nStuart was on a really good run, which came to a crashing haunt in week 10. He lost the corporate pitch to the other team, and with it, Stuart returned to bad habits. He tried selling tour tickets outside the office of a professional tour company, and then he went on a rampage on the opposing team\u2019s selling location. All of this resulted in him losing the task, and he was pretty dead set on going.\n\nAnd yet he didn\u2019t, primarily because of him fighting for his life. I won\u2019t argue that he should\u2019ve stayed, but let\u2019s be honest, how many of us remember what Liz said to defend herself? We all know what Stuart said. I\u2019m not even going to say it, we all know what he said.\n\nHere\u2019s the interesting thing about Stuart in retrospect. I remember people finding him really annoying and really silly, but honestly, he was more professional than I remember. He said the odd occasional quip, but he wasn\u2019t mucking about all the time.\n\nI think the series he was in was the biggest factor in retrospect. Series 6 was probably the most serious the show had ever been. Most of the candidates who entered were far more serious than usual, and they didn\u2019t have much personality to speak of. Stuart being as bubbly and energetic as he was probably stood out a lot more as a result.\n\nAnother thing that stands out to me was Stuart\u2019s exit. Essentially he was fired in a really ferocious manner for lying in his CV about the type of telecoms license his company had. Something I find rather amusing today, where dishonest claims are made all the time. Some of these candidates even got sent to the final (cough cough James cough cough).\n\nLord Sugar stated on Why I Fired Them that he regretted unleashing his anger all on Stuart. I suppose what it really showed was how serious The Apprentice was in series 6. It was the most serious the show ever was, and at the time he was on it, he was significantly less mature and zanier than the traditional candidate at the time, especially from this series. If Stuart was on nowadays, he\u2019d be considered one of the most mature of the series.\n\nSadly Stuart passed away in 2015. He was still so young at the time, younger than most of us on here are now, and it really is a shame to see such an icon gone from us so soon. He may not be on Earth anymore, but for all us Apprentice diehards, he will always remain in our hearts.",

      "title": "The Uncomfortable Truth About Cashmere and How Sustainable Herding Makes All the Difference",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI spend a lot of time working with cashmere, and while the silky-soft feel is what we all love, there's an uncomfortable reality behind the luxury that rarely gets discussed. It boils down to this: not all cashmere is created equal, and the cheap stuff is literally changing the face of the planet.\n\nI wanted to break down the \"fast fashion cashmere\" problem and show you what true, sustainable luxury cashmere production actually looks like on the ground.\n\n**The Problem: Why Your $50 Cashmere Sweater Isn't a Bargain**\n\nCashmere comes from the fine undercoat of the Cashmere goat, which is naturally shed in the spring. It's rare, it's fine (measured in microns), and it's expensive to produce ethically.\n\nThe issue started when fast fashion brands caught on. When demand skyrocketed, the price had to plummet. To meet this massive, cheap demand, producers did three things that created a huge ecological and quality crisis:\n\n1. **They Increased Herd Sizes Dramatically:** More goats = more cashmere. Simple, right? But the fragile grasslands and ecosystems in places like Mongolia and Tibet can only sustain a certain number of grazing animals.\n2. **Overgrazing & Desertification:** Goats don't *trim* grass; they uproot it. When there are too many goats in one area, they eat the root systems, leaving the soil exposed. This accelerates desertification\u2014turning fertile land into desert. It\u2019s an irreversible environmental disaster.\n3. **They Took Short, Coarse Fibers:** When quality is ignored for quantity, they harvest *all* the fiber, including the coarser, shorter hairs. This requires more chemical processing to soften it up, and it's why that bargain sweater pills into a ball of fluff after three wears. The quality is bad because the production is destructive.\n\nThe result is a fiber that's cheaper, less durable, and comes with a high environmental cost.\n\n**The Solution: Back to Tradition and Regenerative Practices**\n\nTo make cashmere truly \"natural\" and ethical, you have to prioritize the health of the land and the animal over profit margins. This is the ethos we follow.\n\n**1. Working with Small Nomadic Families, Not Industrial Farms:** Instead of huge industrial herds, we partner with small, traditional nomadic communities in the Himalayas. For generations, they have practiced rotational grazing. They move their herds seasonally to let the pastureland fully recover. This ensures the grass roots are strong, the soil stays healthy, and the ecosystem is preserved.\n\n**2. Paying a Premium for \"Grade A\" Fiber:** We deliberately pay a significantly higher price (often 3-4x more) for the longest, finest fibers (often 14-15 microns). Why?\n\n* **It's Rarity:** The finest fiber comes from the neck and underbelly, and you only get a few ounces per goat per year.\n* **It\u2019s Durability:** Longer fibers mean tighter, stronger yarn. This is the difference between a sweater that pills immediately and one you wear for two decades. The best quality is a direct result of the most sustainable, low-impact practice.\n\n**3. True Transparency (The Social Impact):** In many regions, low cashmere prices hurt the herders. Our model ensures the communities we work with are paid a fair, above-market wage. This stabilizes their traditional way of life, which is essential for maintaining the very sustainable herding practices the land needs. You are essentially investing in the stability of a whole ecosystem and culture.\n\n**The Impact: Why it Matters to Your Wardrobe**\n\nWhen you choose truly sustainable cashmere, the fiber is:\n\n* **Truly Natural:** It is minimally processed because the quality is already high.\n* **Stronger and Lasts Longer:** It holds its shape and structure, making it a genuine investment piece.\n* **Inherently Ethical:** The environmental and social debt is factored out, leaving you with an item that genuinely feels good, in every sense of the word.\n\nIt\u2019s about shifting your mindset from 'fast fashion luxury' to 'slow fashion investment.' A single, high-quality, sustainably-sourced cashmere item is a zero-waste win compared to five cheap sweaters that will end up in a landfill.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Have you noticed a difference in quality between a mass-market cashmere sweater and one from a smaller, ethical source?\n\nFull disclosure: I am a co-founder of a luxury cashmere brand called Himalayan Warmth. My intent here is purely educational. We believe people should know the whole story behind their clothes, regardless of where they shop.",

But there\u2019s another key factor that can significantly impact your truck or SUV\u2019s fuel economy, handling, and comfort: tire weight.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3rx7oh13xxf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9736a3dad5f76fa76fb535a08160d23a0b13e59d\n\nIn a recent comparison of leading all-terrain tires, the Nitto Terra Grappler G3 A/T consistently came out on top for weight savings \u2014 and that matters more than you might think, especially for Toyota truck and SUV owners.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwe23sd33xxf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e46418ae6064a69ddcb9311538c80885493cfe94\n\n**Why Tire Weight Matters for Toyota Trucks and SUVs**\n\nToyota vehicles like the **Tacoma**, **Tundra**, and **4Runner** are known for durability, off-road capability, and long-term value. But adding heavier aftermarket tires can undo some of those benefits by increasing strain on the drivetrain, suspension, and brakes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s why lighter all-terrain tires make a big difference:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Better Fuel Economy**  \nLighter tires reduce rolling resistance. That means less fuel burned \u2014 especially in city driving, where the stop-and-go cycle is most affected by rotating mass.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Faster Acceleration and Improved Braking**  \nToyota trucks aren't built for speed \u2014 but reducing unsprung weight can noticeably improve acceleration and reduce stopping distance.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Less Wear on Suspension and Drivetrain**  \nComponents like shocks, wheel bearings, and axles wear out faster under heavier loads. Lighter tires help preserve these parts.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Smoother Ride, On and Off-Road**  \nWhether you're crawling trails in your 4Runner or commuting in your Tacoma, reducing unsprung weight helps the suspension work more efficiently.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vb7iyon53xxf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dd30bfaa40cff0ef494952e9bdce93dea251617\n\n**Nitto Terra Grappler G3 A/T vs. KO3 and AT4W: Which Is Lightest?**\n\nThe Nitto Terra Grappler G3 A/T is consistently lighter than competing tires like the BFGoodrich KO3 and Falken AT4W across popular sizes used by Toyota trucks and SUVs.\n\n**Tire Weight Comparison (lbs):**\n\n|| || |**Tire Size**|**Terra Grappler G3**|**BFG KO3**|**Falken AT4W**| |**LT245/75R16**|**45.99 \u2705**|49.0|47.6| |**LT265/70R17**|**48.74 \u2705**|54.4|53.2| |**LT275/70R17**|**49.93 \u2705**|58.3|58.1| |**LT275/65R18**|**51.32 \u2705**|58.0|57.1| |**LT275/65R20**|**54.78 \u2705**|61.8|65.3| |**LT295/55R20**|**57.89 \u2705**|63.9|64.6|\n\n\u2705 = Lightest tire in its class\n\n(Tire sizes listed based on availability of each brand/model at time of publishing)\n\nThese size options are popular among modified **Tacomas**, lifted **4Runners**, and **Tundras** used for off-roading or towing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s2fn42873xxf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6edaa7b8241467b37299fb5ea9e083d801d63c44\n\n**Real Benefits for Toyota Owners**\n\nChoosing a set of Nitto Terra Grappler G3 A/T tires could mean saving up to 32 lbs of rotating mass in total compared to other brands depending on the tire sizes being applied. For your Tacoma or 4Runner, that\u2019s enough to:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improve throttle response and hill climbing\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Make braking safer when towing or hauling\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduce fatigue on long off-road trips\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protect suspension components over time\n\n**What About Strength?**\n\nDon\u2019t let the lighter weight fool **you. The Terra Grappler G3 maintains strong towing capacity, excellent off-road durability, and offers one of the best mileage warranties in its class:**\n\n* **70,000 miles** for P-metric sizes\n* **55,000 miles** for LT/flotation sizes\n\n[See full warranty details here](https://www.drivingline.com/articles/best-all-terrain-tires-built-to-last-mileage-warranty-showdown/)\n\n**Conclusion: A Smart Tire Choice for Toyota Trucks and SUVs**\n\nIf you drive a Tacoma, Tundra, or 4Runner and want a tire that combines off-road capability with lighter weight and on-road comfort, the Nitto Terra Grappler G3 A/T stands out in 2025.\n\nYou\u2019ll benefit from:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fuel efficiency savings\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Enhanced handling and acceleration\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Less strain on your truck\u2019s key components\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A more comfortable ride \u2014 on pavement or off-road\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n**Q: Why does tire weight matter for my Tacoma, Tundra, or 4Runner?**  \nA: These trucks and SUVs already carry a lot of weight. Lighter tires reduce stress on your suspension, brakes, and drivetrain \u2014 helping you get more out of your vehicle.\n\n**Q: Will lighter tires reduce durability?**  \nA: No. The Nitto Terra Grappler G3 A/T uses advanced materials to stay light without sacrificing strength, towing capacity, or off-road grip. In fact, their high mileage warranty speaks to how durable these all-terrain tires are.\n\n**Q: How much gas can I save?**  \nA: Savings vary, but reducing 20\u201330 lbs of rotating mass makes a noticeable difference in stop-and-go driving\u2014common for commuters and weekend off-roaders alike.\n\n**Q: Do lighter tires help off-road?**  \nA: Yes. Less unsprung mass = better suspension response = more traction and smoother control on trails.\n\n**Q: Can I use Terra Grappler G3 A/T for towing?**  \nA: Absolutely. Despite being lighter, these tires maintain strong load ratings suitable for towing with Tundras or hauling gear in your Tacoma.\n\nFor more specs or to find the correct sized Terra Grappler G3 for your Toyota, visit the official Nitto website:  \n[https://www.nittotire.com/light-truck-tires/terra-grappler-g3-all-terrain-light-truck-tire/](https://www.nittotire.com/light-truck-tires/terra-grappler-g3-all-terrain-light-truck-tire/)",

      "title": "Comparing 3 monthly retro game subscription boxes",
      "selftext": "A couple of months ago I've made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1mxndfs/best_value_i_got_from_a_monthly_subscription_so/) where I said I'll get a few more subscription boxes from the 3 companies I'm subscribed to and then post a comparison. So, here it is ...  \n\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated to any of the companies nor do I know any of their employees, I'm not getting paid by 'big retro box' or anything of the sort. I did not put any referral link, if there's one, it's reddit, not me. I do it for fun, and I hope people will find this useful and support these businesses (or not, I don't care).**\n\n  \nThe 3 companies are, in the order their boxes arrive each month: [videogamesmonthly](http://videogamesmonthly.com) (VGM), [retrogametreasure](http://retrogametreasure.com) (RGT), [ggretrobox](https://ggretrobox.com/) (GGR). I've been subscribed to VGM and RGT for at least 1 year and to GGR for 2 months.\n\n  \n**1. Packaging**\n\nAll 3 companies use custom boxes as seen in the first picture. While VGM's is the most uninteresting, they include goodies like stickers and rubber fridge magnets, the others do not. RGT has a very charming pixel design which fits their brand name well. GGR uses artwork from someone called Graven Ravenwolf - he's credited on the box - so I'm glad it's not AI, and it's cool that it's a different design every month, but it's a bit too busy for me.\n\nOverall, I'd say RGT wins this (my subjective opinion), with GGR a close second.\n\n  \n**2. Price**\n\nVGM is $44.99 for '\\~5 games per month' - shipping is around $10. They have different tiers up to a $150 per month '\\~20 games' plan\n\nRGT is $39.99, shipping is around $10 - they have no other tier but you can prepay 3, 6 ,12 months for a discount.\n\nGGR is $65, shipping is free - they have no other tier not any discount.\n\nEven with shipping factored in, GGR is the most expensive. As this metric is somewhat irrelevant, without looking at 'value', I'll just not declare any winner here.\n\n  \n**3. Site features**\n\nAll 3 websites are able to track your collection. RGT and GGR will automatically add the games they send to your virtual collection, and will try to avoid sending you duplicates. For VGM you have to do it yourself. GGR's tracker seems slightly more modern, includes a barcode reader to enter your games faster.\n\nIn terms of account management:\n\n* VGM doesn't really have an account management page, can't change password, can't change shipping address, no idea how to cancel\n* RGT has an account management page, but you need to send an email to unsubscribe\n* GGR also has an account management page, which has an unsubscribe button - much appreciated. It also allows you to authenticate with Google and a couple others - also much appreciated. One thing I didn't like about GGR was that it doesn't allow you to select fewer than 5 systems, the others do. **Unfortunately they send me a lot of NES games in my latest box which I didn't have selected.**\n\nGGR wins here, RGT second, VGM a distant third\n\n  \n**4. Games condition**\n\nYou will not get pristine condition games with any of the services. For cartridge games it's very rare to get a CIB game, it happens more often with DS/3DS games. Games will have stickers and sometimes writing on them. Since I've been subscribed to VGM and RGT for longer, I can only say that VGM have sent games in worse condition than RGT. I only have 2 boxes from GGR, so I don't have enough samples to rate it. Based on what I've got in the past 2 months, I think RGT and GGR are on par with VGM a bit behind.\n\n  \n**5. Value**\n\nThe only way to not make this subjective is to take pricecharting prices (and mynty's), and compare them to the subscription cost. I will not include the shipping price here. There's is a 'Value' line which represents the % difference between the pricecharting value and the subscription price. If it's > 0 then the games are worth more than you paid.\n\nMy system selection (you can set that on their websites, allowing you to select which systems you want games for):\n\n* VGM: 1 box: N64 and GameGear, 1 box: SNES and N64\n* RGT: both boxes: SNES, N64, 3DS\n* GGR: both boxes: N64, GBC, SNES, GB, Genesis\n\nSeptember box\n\n    VGM -----------------------------------------\n                        PriceCharting       Mynty\n    TazMania (GG)       7.17                4.00\n    EH Boxing (GG)      7.71                2.00\n    NBA JAM (GG)        5.00                7.00\n    XMen (GG)           8.84                11.00\n    WaveRace64 (N64)    14.25               13.00\n    \n    Total               42.97               37.00\n    Price               44.99\n    Value%              -4.7%               -12.6%\n    \n    RGT -----------------------------------------\n                        PriceCharting       Mynty \n    MK2 (SNES)          15.39               17.00\n    Rainbow Six (N64)   12.87               12.00\n    Mario Kart 7 (3DS)  13.01               12.00\n    \n    Total               41.24               41.00\n    Price               39.99\n    Value%              3.0%                %2.5\n    \n    GGR -----------------------------------------\n                        PriceCharting       Mynty\n    Turok2 (N64)        13.00               12.00\n    Mario Party (N64)   34.95               37.00\n    ToeJam (GEN)        26.09               26.00\n    \n    Total               74.04               75.00\n    Price               65.00\n    Value%              12.2%               13.3%\n\nOctober box\n\n    VGM -----------------------------------------\n                        PriceCharting       Mynty\n    ScoobyDoo (SNS)     10.19               7.00\n    Arcade's Rev (SNS)  12.64               7.00\n    All Star (SNS)      4.80                6.00\n    M:I (N64)           9.92                8.00\n    F1 (N64)            7.62                6.00\n    \n    Total               45.17               34.00\n    Price               44.99\n    Value%              0.4%                -32.3%\n    \n    RGT -----------------------------------------\n                        PriceCharting       Mynty\n    MK3 (SNS)           13.65               18.00\n    Pitfall (SNS)       10.00               7.00\n    F1 (N64)            7.62                6.00\n    CN Battle (3DS)     8.5                 6.00\n    \n    Total               39.77               37.00\n    Price               39.99\n    Value%              -0.6%               -8.1%\n    \n    GGR -----------------------------------------\n                        PriceCharting       Mynty\n    SMB 5 Screw (NES)   17.76               19.00\n    Baseball Star (NES) 14.26               15.00\n    Exodus (NES)        17.00               17.00\n    SW Racer (N64)      10.75               12.00\n    \n    Total               59.77               63.00\n    Price               65.00\n    Value%              -8.75%              -3.2%\n\nLooking at these, it would seem that GGR has the best value, but keep in mind that the condition of the most expensive game (Mario Party in the first box) wasn't \"$35\" great, and, also very important: **they shouldn't have sent me NES games in the second box, it wasn't selected.**\n\nOn the other hand, one important fact is the shipping price which wasn't factored in for VGM and RGT, so if you added that, GGR would win this convincingly. As it stands right now, I'd say GGR has only a slight edge because of their screw-up, and VGM is the worst.\n\nKeep in mind GGR is a relatively new company, so they might have not hit the game 'drought' the other 2 companies might face after so many years - they probably built some inventory before starting the business and wanted to make a great first impression - not sure if it's sustainable.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nAnd that's it - mathematically, GGR probably wins, but having received games for a system I did not select is a BIG red flag. Over the long run, RGT beat VGM without a doubt (again, I had these 2 for much longer than GGR) - RGT have been reliable, didn't send me duplicates (unlike VGM) and they offer adequate value. I'll probably stay with GGR and RGT.",

There\u2019s a chain of diners in small towns with almost no brand. They want to scale and launch an animated advertising series. The main fear: will the money come back? They\u2019re not Disney, able to cover misfires with a single blockbuster.\n\nPeople often cite Riot: \u201cLook, after Arcane\u2019s success they launched a few more series.\u201d But from public discussions, Arcane itself was loss-making, and yet the company keeps moving forward.\n\nThis leads to a provocative conclusion: animation tends to pay off directly mostly where there\u2019s already a strong brand or IP. But that doesn\u2019t mean the path is closed to \u201csmaller\u201d players\u2014it just means proof of payback has to rely on different metrics.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example closer to the \u201cdiner\u201d\u2014content around games. Series based on well-known titles (like Supercell\u2019s Clash-A-Rama!) more often work as ecosystem amplifiers (retention, reactivation, LTV growth). That\u2019s an uneven fight for a brand starting from zero: direct content payback without an existing IP is an order of magnitude harder.\nBut, to be fair, projects based on major mobile IPs that have huge visual-production machines (for example, Rovio with Angry Birds) are by no means guaranteed successes (Rovio\u2019s financials have been rapidly deteriorating, judging by SensorTower data).\n\nWith so many factors, it\u2019s easy to get lost\u2014so how do you measure the success of an animated project?\n\nThe industry is going through a hard time. But if businesses make smart, metrics-driven animated products (even shorter and cheaper ones), it could genuinely revive the space.",

I am looking for a certain \"cool\" or \"unique\" factor as well, so I would love some advice in what direction to go in. I would like to be able to game at 1440p 60+fps and have room for a full tower if that's the direction I go in. I play a lot of indies, but I also enjoy more demanding modern titles like Helldivers 2, Warhammer 40K, Baldurs Gate 3 and Borderlands 4. I have no brand allegiance to anyone and am open to all suggestions. I am currently leaning towards a Framework Desktop with an Oculink eGPU setup. (I already have the eGPU and an AOOSTAR AG02 so that doesn't factor into the budget.) Please throw me your wildest ideas and suggestions!!",

      "selftext": "If you're thinking I'm talking about prices - I'm not. High-end watches are by nature expensive and that bar generally moves upwards over 10+ years.\n\nMy gripe also isn't with watchmakers that have somewhat of a limited production, such as F. P. Journe.\n\nBut why is it all of a sudden common practice for authorized dealers to hold back common models and creating artificial scarcity? I recognize there are exceptions to this for limited models across various brands. I can also appreciate the general appeal of having something exclusive and the exclusivity factor driving revenue. With that being said, is the prerequisite of purchasing \"lesser\" watches to obtain the opportunity to purchase a more prestigious one really proving to be that lucrative for the industry?\n\nHaving spoken with dealers more than a decade ago on the topic of models with various complications, it's always been a situation of \"let us know when you're ready, and we'll have it here next week\". Again, all within reason. You'd be lucky to get the same treatment after spending hundreds of thousands for watches you don't actually have an interest in, just for the opportunity to buy the one you do want.\n\nWould love to hear about your experiences and insights into what caused the fundamentals to shift. I'm getting the sense it's better than it used to be a couple of years ago the overall change has been quite off-putting for someone who isn't interested in courting the AD.",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nAfter a focused research period, I\u2019ve published a detailed comparative analysis of the digital-marketing agency scene in Paris \u2014 an invaluable tool if you\u2019re working in or moving into France. Thought I\u2019d share here for anyone who might benefit.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Here\u2019s the link:**  \n[https://digitalmarketingsupermarket.com/blog/digital-marketing-agencies-in-paris/](https://digitalmarketingsupermarket.com/blog/digital-marketing-agencies-in-paris/)\n\n\n\n# Why I did this\n\nFrance is a major European market yet often under-represented in English-language agency-landscape breakdowns. French consumer behaviour, regulatory frameworks, language dynamics, and market maturity all mean that *Paris-based agency selection* isn\u2019t equivalent to London or Berlin. I aimed to fill that gap.\n\n\n\n# What the analysis contains\n\n* Profiles of **key Paris-based digital-marketing agencies**: their service offers (SEO, SEA, social, performance, creative), team size, international vs domestic client focus.\n* A breakdown of how they differentiate: high\u2010performance acquisition boutiques, full\u2010service consultancies, creative/brand hybrids with strong digital execution.\n* Insights into market nuances: bilingual (French/English) capability, localisation vs domestic-only, regulatory expectations (e.g., French data & privacy laws), media channel ecosystems.\n* A set of selection criteria tailored to the French market: Group vs SME mindset, agency culture (Paris vs decentralised France), cost expectations, language/communication considerations.\n\n\n\n# Three agency archetypes I found (for your decision matrix)\n\n* A \u201clarge scale\u201d Paris agency with global reach, multi-discipline offering, strong English-language servicing for multinational clients.\n* A French-native performance marketing specialist, focused on acquisition & optimisation for French domestic brands.\n* A creative-digital hybrid with strong brand strategy roots but also performance delivery \u2014 useful for international clients who need French localisation plus full\u2010funnel execution.\n\n\n\n# Why this is strategically important\n\n* If you\u2019re advising clients or managing expansion into France, you\u2019ll need an agency that not only understands France but *speaks France* \u2014 language, culture, channels, consumer mindset.\n* Selection frameworks valid in the UK/US might not fully apply in France: bilingual teams, European headquarters presence, localisation beyond translation matter.\n* Having a research-backed set of options and comparative heuristics saves time, reduces risk, and lets you brief more intelligently.\n* As a consultant working with senior marketing teams, this gives you a credible tool you can present confidently: \u201cHere are your Paris options, their positions, here\u2019s what to ask.\u201d\n\n\n\n# Questions for the community\n\n* Have you worked with Paris-based digital-marketing agencies? What were the surprises compared to UK/US agencies?\n* For those targeting French market entry: what did you find most challenging in selecting/working with an agency in France?\n* From your experience: when choosing a Paris agency, what *one factor* would you say is non-negotiable?\n\n\n\nHappy to dive deeper into specific agencies from the list, compare them side-by-side, or share a downloadable matrix if someone wants.",

I\u2019ve been asked to design a show-stopper cocktail for the holiday season all proceeds will go to charity, and it will be rolled out nationwide.\n\nThe execs suggested dry ice for the \u201cwow\u201d factor, but I ruled it out as it\u2019a too risky and inconsistent. Still, I get the vision: something festive, visually striking, and easy enough for all our properties to replicate.\n\nI\u2019ve thought about doing a fat-washed spirit or a clarified milk punch since both are approachable yet elevated techniques. But I\u2019d love to hear more creative, scalable ideas something that looks high-end but is safe and practical for volume service.\n\nWhat kind of flavor profiles or visual elements would you use for a holiday cocktail like this?",

      "title": "Starting up Hotshot In 2025",
      "selftext": "Alright I\u2019m gonna keep this as real as possible because hotshot will humble you quick if you walk in blind. I\u2019m not here to talk you out of it\u2026 just giving you the real layout so you don\u2019t drain your bank account before you even haul your first load.\n\nHere\u2019s what it actually takes in 2025\u2026\n\nFirst thing\nThe startup costs are higher than people think. A solid 3500 or 4500 diesel truck is usually anywhere from thirty thousand to fifty thousand depending on mileage. A decent 40 ft trailer adds another nine thousand to fifteen thousand. Most folks underestimate this part and end up buying something that can\u2019t handle the weight or won\u2019t pass inspections.\n\nSecond thing\nInsurance is the part nobody is ready for. First year hotshot insurance for a brand new authority in 2025 is averaging eighteen thousand to thirty thousand a year depending on your driving record and your state. Texas, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Oklahoma have some of the better rates. California and New York will hit you in the mouth. And it\u2019s usually ten percent to twenty percent down upfront to even activate the policy.\n\nThird thing\nYour authority takes about twenty one days to activate after you file everything. During that time you need to handle your BOC3, UCR, MCS150, and get your COI ready for the load boards you wanna run. Most guys stall out right here because they miss one filing and their authority gets delayed another week.\n\nFourth thing\nYour equipment list isn\u2019t optional. You need chains. Binders. Ratchet straps. A good tarp. Corner protectors. A fire extinguisher. Flares or triangles. A triangle kit is literally required. DOT is strict on hotshots and one missed piece of safety gear can get you put out of service right there on the spot. A basic starter setup usually runs around one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars depending on the quality you buy.\n\nFifth thing\nRevenue depends on your lanes and your hustle. Hotshot rates in 2025 are averaging two dollars to two fifty a mile depending on the region. Midwest usually pays better. Southeast has more volume but lower rates. West coast is hit or miss. A consistent hotshot running smart can clear twenty five hundred to five thousand a week in revenue\u2026 but that\u2019s revenue\u2026 not profit.\n\nSixth thing\nExpenses matter. Fuel\u2026 insurance\u2026 truck payment\u2026 trailer payment\u2026 factoring\u2026 maintenance\u2026 tires\u2026 oil\u2026 repairs. Diesel trucks usually need oil changes every seven thousand to ten thousand miles and those can be one hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars depending on where you go. Tires for a dually and trailer add up quick too. If you don\u2019t track your costs week by week the money will evaporate.\n\nSeventh thing\nLoad boards. Yes\u2026 DAT and Truckstop are where most hotshots start. But the real money is in direct shippers. Farm equipment\u2026 oilfield stuff\u2026 machinery\u2026 steel\u2026 construction materials\u2026 all that. Call local companies. Walk into warehouses. Build relationships. Brokers will get you rolling\u2026 shippers will keep you fed.\n\nLast thing\nHotshot isn\u2019t easy money. It\u2019s real work. Long hours. Deadhead miles. Empty weeks. Slow seasons. DOT checks. But if you plan it right\u2026 understand your numbers\u2026 and build real lanes\u2026 you can make it work. Just don\u2019t jump in because you saw somebody flash a big settlement screenshot.\n\nHope this helps someone \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

      "title": "Why did I get crushed by people who put out similar power numbers to me in a triathlon?",
      "selftext": "As I reup my cycling training again, I need to know if my power meter numbers are off. It feels like they are but maybe I am just better than I think I am. My question here is given the info, if you think my wattage numbers are off, or there is just a combination of factors that made me be so much slower than my competitors. I have checked the specs of the crank arm and such 60 times, and it is set at 175, same as the crank length. \n\nI got a power meter around a month or two ago, and the numbers it has been giving me are way higher than I expected them to be. I raced a triathlon a couple months ago, and I was the first one out of the water, and about 5-7 cyclists just flew past me between mile 8 and the end of the 25 mile bike ride. \n\nWhat confuses me is the power numbers I have seen looking back at that race. The guy who went 57:30 in the 40k bike put out 280 watts, the guy who went a 1:02 put out 234 watts, and the guy who went 1:00-1:01 put out around 240 watts. \n\n**Here is my timeline:** \n\nMay 1st: Bought a Kestrel Talon X off FB marketplace to race a tri with. Brand new cyclist.\n\nAugust 16th: Raced 1:16 in the 40k olympic tri, I went too hard and fell apart completely, 20k times were 35:30/40:30. Run went to shit\n\nAugust 31st: Bought a power meter, favero assioma pedals.\n\nSeptember 10th: My highest sustained wattage ride, around 2 hours to 2:30 at 210-220W\n\nSeptember 28th: Did a 20 minute FTP test with a output of 276W, [intervals.icu](http://intervals.icu) says that my FTP is 262. Obviously this was much harder than I went during the race but I can't believe I was 15-20 minutes slower.\n\nOctober 25th (what prompted this post): I did a 135-145 bpm ride for an hour at over 200W.\n\nIn the last month I've done a lot of running due to the tri season ending and there still being running races, but as I reup my cycling training again, I need to figure out if something is off.\n\n**Some Factors as to why I could have been so much slower than those leaders:**\n\nI am around 190 lbs at 6'1, and my competitors were a little shorter and probably closer to 150-170 pounds (total guess).  My equipment was largely basic, but I did wear a tri suit. \n\nI ride a 2017 kestral talon x with clip on aero bars, old set up, basic wheelset, and at the time of the race I didn't have an aero helmet. \n\nI completely fell apart during the race. Poor race management. \n\nI trained a lot between the tri and the ftp test. I did lots of LONG rides and I probably was more fit. \n\nMy wattage sensor is off (what I am trying to figure out here).\n\nIf anyone can help me make sense of my data I would appriciate it. I have checked the crank arm length 6 times.\n\n",

      "selftext": "NOTE: This idea is--rather must--subject to change from the recommendations of other members of this community. If you think otherwise, feel free to voice your thoughts in the comment. I will try to be responsive so that we can reach certain agreement.\n\n**GOAL:** Create a megathread--or pin a post--where a list of _BOTH_ official retailers _AND_ grey market sellers of fountain pen are available in a _MAJOR REGIONS_ (either continental or national) OR if someone will contribute a list to that region.\n\n**BY WHO**: People who are interested _AND_ wants to voluntarily contribute to the said list or comment to the said mega thread or append to the pinned post. In short, everyone who wants to.\n\n**RATIONALE**\n\nI've seen people who get lost and bought from crappy grey market dealers somewhere in Amazon or eBay or other site due to inaccessibility of official retailers or the expensive shipping. For example, for people in South Asia, Goulet Pens and JetPens, even though they ship here, the shipping is much more expensive than what you've bought. In some cases, as in the previous post, the markup\u2014determined by retailer and the brand itself\u2014in certain regions makes the pen _too_ expensive ($200 < $100 for Pilot C74, from Goulet and penpen-avenue, respectively, at of the moment of writing).\n\nThere might be people against this, but also consider some people interested in this hobby or wants to procure their \"holy grail\" but cannot due to inaccessibility arising from many factors. Of those, the concern here are regional unavailability, high shipping costs, or expensiveness due to markup. Maybe we can offer some options as a work around\u2014or solution\u2014to those issues, especially if we don't, can't, or does not want to offer our money. Other people don't even know such solutions exist; they simply think that fountains are expensive (i.e. Pilot C823 is $250 vs $384 in penpen-avenue and Goulet, respectively). Unbeknownst to them, unfortunately, that they can procure it from Japan\u2014or other grey market dealers\u2014for half the price (excluding shipping). Certainly, we won't coerce or divert them from buying other retailers, rather let them know that they have other options. \n\nWe have list, but it is not up-to-date anymore, and they are only official retailers, as far as I remember back then.

      "title": "WIBTAH if I rented this house?",
      "selftext": "Good morning. Apologies for the lengthy post.\n\nMy wife (K) and I have been presented an opportunity to rent a home from her step-dad\u2019s cousin (Q) We were put into contact with him by her mom, who learned he was going to rent his house out last weekend at his birthday dinner they both (mom and stepdad) attended.\n\nI talked to him quite a bit, yesterday. Basically, house is perfect price, brand new and basically right in the middle of everywhere we need to be. It would cut at least 30 minutes off my wife\u2019s 2 hour commute and make my 20 a few minutes shorter. Only reason he\u2019s leaving is because he met his current fianc\u00e9 basically right after he bought, and now they\u2019re buying a house together, but waiting until the market is a bit better. Basically came to the agreement that we would be moving forward if everything went well when we went to look at it. \n\nLast night we were invited to dinner at K\u2019s mom\u2019s house, and my wife casually brought it up, and her step-dad just shut down. Started saying \u2018I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s a bad idea\u2019 or \u2018yeah but you don\u2019t know Q like I do\u2019 sprinkled with some \u2018yeah it\u2019s a really nice house and the location is great for you\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re adults\u2019 you can do whatever\u2019. Then rushed out as soon as he was done eating to start chain smoking.\n\nObviously we were kind of blind sided because how the hell did it get this far without him knowing? Why is this such a bombshell?  we getting the brunt of what seems to be effectively a temper tantrum because of their lack of communication? \n\nWe went outside after giving him a minute. After talking about Q\u2019s history very vaguely, reminding us about familial drama, he touched on the fact that no one in his family talks to Q. But this all seems to stem from things that happened prior to his divorce and his (very toxic) father dying. I feel like there must\u2019ve been a big shift because who I met is not the person I heard about before. Seems to me his father, ex wife and personal politics were big factors in their decisions, but he only has one of those now. \n\nSince then, my wife\u2019s mom started inviting him to things. He always shows up, is super nice. Then we started inviting him to kids birthdays and stuff. Again he shows up. He\u2019s shown my family nothing but love. That\u2019s a lot more than some people we could \u2018trust\u2019 in their eyes. \n\nHer step dad worries that he\u2019ll kick us out if he\u2019s dissatisfied with us as tenants (the very next day. which is illegal) or come after him for money if for some reason we didn\u2019t pay (again illegal). he says he doesn\u2019t care if his relationship with Q goes south. But if it does, he doesn\u2019t want it to affect us either. We also live next door to her parents, and think that may play into him not wanting us to move.\n\nIn our opinion, we wouldn\u2019t let any of these things happen? We\u2019d be stuck in a situation like that with anyone we\u2019d rent from, anyways. If we keep it professional, sign a lease and do everything we\u2019re supposed to, an issue will never arise. This is an amazing opportunity as he\u2019s not requiring a deposit, and is knocking off a sizable chunk to be able to keep his RV there. We also aren\u2019t planning for longer than a year or two as we would hopefully be in the position to buy a house, and if everything works out it could be that one when he\u2019s ready to sell.\n\nWe really need this. But I\u2019m not sure they are aware of exactly how bad. We didn\u2019t realize how miserable we were being so isolated from everything, and how expensive it really is to have to drive a minimum of 15 miles just to get to a store or an hour from our closest friend or my wife\u2019s other half of her family. This would knock everything down basically in half. We also currently pay basically the same for a deteriorating double wide trailer on property we cannot utilize because it\u2019s not fenced in. It is not safe for my very young children to play outside because of the stray dogs and wild animals. Our land lords don\u2019t fix anything unless absolutely necessary, and have been very difficult to communicate with if it\u2019s not about money. \n\nI see and want to validate her step dad\u2019s concerns. I know her mom (who has now flipped sides to not think it\u2019s a good idea idk if it\u2019s genuine or damage control) didn\u2019t even think about any of that stuff when going through with putting us in contact, so really how bad was he? Like i know if someone were as bad as he\u2019s made out to have been,even for a millisecond, I wouldn\u2019t even give them my daughters number. \n\nThis just makes too much sense for us, and we\u2019d be wary of anyone we\u2019d rent from, anyways. Then again, we don\u2019t want her stepdad to feel we\u2019ve betrayed him. We also don\u2019t want him to \u2018retaliate\u2019 against us if we don\u2019t listen to him. \n\nWould we be the assholes if we rented that house?\n\nEdit: There will be a formal lease. If that doesn\u2019t look good we won\u2019t do it. If we get a bad feeling we won\u2019t do it. If the house doesn\u2019t seem like it will work we won\u2019t do it. \n\n\n",

      "selftext": "\u200bThe truth we, as long-time players, must recognize is that Magic: The Gathering is a fundamentally different game now. This change is not accidental; it is a calculated, intentional, and inevitable evolution of the brand. Our experience as veteran players is no longer the primary factor guiding product design. We are, quite simply, an old demographic, and the game is no longer being designed for us.\n\n\u200bThe year 2024 serves as a critical delineation for this new stage of Magic. We saw a clear pivot toward easily accessible themes\u2014or what many call the \"hat sets\"\u2014which prioritize broad appeal over deep lore. These simple, easily digestible gimmicks and \"cute animal\" sets are transparent mechanisms engineered to intrigue and onboard new players.\n\n\u200bEven within the traditional, in-universe releases, the game has been deliberately de-fanged. Comparing the current product line to the 2023 lineup reveals a stark difference: the complexity, weight, and cohesive fantasy flavor that initially drew us in have been significantly diminished. The current product, across its core releases, feels uninspired, tacky, and boring.\n\n\u200bThis is what Magic is now, and while that evolution is a business reality, we are allowed to dislike it. If you share this sentiment\u2014that the new direction is creatively flawed and the product is no longer serving its original core\u2014I implore you to take the only consumer action that matters: stop buying MTG products.\n\n\u200bYou are no longer the target demographic. Continuing to buy product is merely validating a direction you fundamentally disapprove of. Stop wasting your money.\n",

      "selftext": "If you\u2019ve ever wondered why some businesses seem to appear effortlessly on Google while others struggle to get noticed, the answer is simple \u2014 [SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](https://www.iplacetechnologies.com/search-engine-optimization/). It\u2019s not just another marketing term; it\u2019s the key to helping your website attract the right audience, gain visibility, and build long-term trust online.\n\nAt its heart, [SEO](https://www.iplacetechnologies.com/search-engine-optimization/) is about **making your website easy to find, easy to understand, and worth visiting**. Whether you\u2019re a local business or a global brand, SEO can transform your website into a powerful digital asset that keeps working for you 24/7.\n\n# [Why SEO Matters More Than Ever](https://www.iplacetechnologies.com/search-engine-optimization/)\n\nIn today\u2019s digital-first world, nearly every customer journey begins with a Google search. Think about it \u2014 when was the last time you looked for a product or service without searching online?\n\nRanking on the first page of Google isn\u2019t just about visibility; it\u2019s about **being in front of your ideal audience at the exact moment they\u2019re looking for you**. Studies show that websites on the first page capture over 90% of total search traffic. If your website isn\u2019t there yet, it\u2019s time to change that.\n\nThat\u2019s where **strategic SEO** comes in. From optimizing your content and website structure to improving speed and mobile usability, every detail helps search engines understand your site better \u2014 and that means more clicks, leads, and conversions.\n\n# The Three Pillars of Effective SEO\n\nTo truly grow your online presence, you need to build your SEO strategy on three strong pillars:\n\n**1. On-Page SEO**  \nThis covers everything you can control on your own website \u2014 keywords, headlines, meta descriptions, and internal linking. Quality content that\u2019s both relevant and valuable helps search engines and readers understand your message clearly.\n\n**2.

Factors like site speed, mobile responsiveness, and clean coding improve the user experience \u2014 and search engines love that.\n\n# SEO Is a Journey, Not a One-Time Task\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about SEO is that it\u2019s a one-time setup. In reality, SEO is an **ongoing process**. Search engine algorithms evolve constantly, and your competitors are optimizing too.\n\nTo stay ahead, you need consistent effort \u2014 updating your content, monitoring analytics, and adjusting strategies.

      "title": "How I Recovered My CODM Account(Guide & Journey)",
      "selftext": "Mods, please pin this post or add this as a guide if you can to the Subreddit. The past month and a half has been a ride of torture and stress for me but I finally got through it all and want to share how I recovered my account, and how other players who got their accounts compromised can do it too. I have gone lengths to track the hackers and everyone involved in the process, how they hack your account, and resale it and I will share it all.\n\nBefore I begin, for the love God, ENABLE 2FA FOR YOUR ACTIVISION LOGIN FROM THEIR WEBSITE and DO NOT TRY TO ESTABLISH ANY CONTACT WITH ANYONE INVOLVED IN COMPROMISING YOUR ACCOUNT. Hackers and scammers usually leave their Telegram IDs in loadout names and expect potential buyers from the world chat or the original Account holder to make contact. If not this, they will mail you fake responses of Recovery Requests that you did not even submit and clicking on the link will take you to a fake Activison Whatsapp Chat claiming to privately recover accounts. Activision DOES NOT have a  Whatsapp Support Service. If you do contact, they will harass you, abuse you, threaten to ban your account, or even delete it. PLEASE, refrain from doing so. Add the two-factor authenticator, any trusted one will work, I use Google. Even if the hacker gets his hands on your activision login, they cannot change your login and password if you have 2FA enabled as it is needed to login to the Activision website. In case your account gets hacked, there are two outcomes,\n\nA. You had 2FA enabled(my case) and the hacker could only link additional accounts to your CODM account without changing your activision credentials. This also helped me to change my Activision email and password from the compromised one to a completely new which made tha hackers clueless about my Activision credentials. Now, another weird this is that for most of us, adding more than two accounts is not possible as there is no plus option to add more. There are instances of players trying to link more than two accounts but they cannot. You can search it on the subreddit. What the hackers do is, that they login to a brand new or factory reset device, download CODM and login to your account from there and the plus sign magically appears(either for line or google, mostly google). If this does not work, they can use a premium VPN to connect to another host server and make the plus sign appear. I have added an image of the hacker replicating what I have said at the end of the images. I do not know the logic behind this but it is possible a 100%.\n\nB. You DID NOT have 2FA enabled and the hacker CHANGED your Activison Login and password. If this happens, unfortunately, there is ABSOLUTELY no chance of recovering your account as everything is linked to your Activison login and the hacker now has complete ownership of the account. Whenever you try to use your old logins, there will be a wrong mail/password error. I have scoured EVERY corner of the Internet and there is no possible solution for these kind of compromised accounts. The ONLY and ONLY chance of recovery is, if you're a big time influencer, like what happened to PTS I think and CODM team was directly involved. \n\nNow, The Recovery Process. \nTrying on the Activision Website Support is completely and utterly useless. After almost three weeks(22 Sep-8 Oct) of contacting and opening new support requests daily, they failed to detect any suspicious activity on my CODM account.\n\nNow, what WILL WORK is, contacting the In-game activision support. Go settings and click on the headphone icon and select chat with Support. Shoutout to u/SorryNarwhalhorn, u/Virtual-Priority-981, and u/SpiralDesignn whose recovery journey helped me a lot. I have uploaded my entire conversation with the Support and although it took me almost 3 weeks of back and forth conversations, they eventually unlinked the unauthorized google account. They will ask you that what kind of unrecognized account is linked after you tell them that your account was hacked and you recognize an account linked that is not yours. In my case, it was Google and it can be Facebook, Apple, or Line too. Provide them with any kind of information they ask for and keep checking for new messages as the support notifications are delayed by 5-12 hours for some reason. I contacted in-game support on 9th of October and I got complete access of my account back on 21st of October. The guide ends here and from here on is the stuff I went through and the people I encountered.\n\nHow my details got leaked, I do not know. I have never clicked on shady links or shared my accounts. Maybe my family uses my login and password on every website that exists on Earth, a breech happened and got things screwed for me \ud83d\ude2d. The hacker linked the Google account and first scammed many of my friends by sharing phishing links and then was trying to sell it for 300$ on his Telegram channel that I have attached above. They usually sell Activision logins as they go for much higher prices but he tried to gamble with selling a Solo Google Login because I was inactive at the time and he thought I wouldn't return. He told the same thing to any buyer that \"the original owner does not play anymore\". He also tried to extort money from me in exchange of the Google login which was another obvious scam. I intercepted two of his deals that he was trying to make while logging into my account. The third person he was trying to sell the account teamed up with me in trying to recover my account from the hacker and kept luring him into false deals while I contacted and waited for the support's response. The hacker saw through us and sold the account to another seller who then finally sold the Google login to a person who was using cheats to play on my account(proof of cheating also attached). Thankfully, I kept logging him out the entire time so he could not play much. \n\nEach and every person, whether it were the hackers or the guy who tried to help me were from Iran. I have attached both the Hackers' Telegram Channels, filled with accounts of poor victims' accounts that are for sale and one of the Hackers' personal ID is also there in case someone from the  team wants to take action against them.",

      "title": "Best PMI for SMEs UK 2025",
      "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI often see questions here from small business owners trying to navigate the group PMI market. I was going through a 2025 guide on the topic and thought I'd summarise the key takeaways, as it might be useful for others weighing up their options.\n\nThe main drivers for SMEs considering PMI seem to be the same ones we all talk about: tackling long NHS waiting lists and reducing the impact of sickness absence on a small team. The core idea is that faster access to diagnostics and treatment can significantly shorten recovery times.\n\nThe guide gave a useful breakdown of the main providers and their general focus for SME policies:\n\n- **Aviva:** Noted for its digital tools and highly flexible policy options.\n- **AXA Health:** Focuses on guided healthcare pathways to help manage costs.\n- **Bupa:** The well-known, trusted brand offering comprehensive cover.\n- **Vitality:** The one with the unique wellness model that rewards healthy living.\n- **WPA:** A not-for-profit insurer often praised for customer service and co-payment options.\n\nA key point was that finding the \"most affordable\" policy is less about the absolute lowest price and more about balancing cost with meaningful cover. A cheap plan that doesn't deliver is a false economy. The main cost-control levers mentioned were the standard ones: adjusting the excess, using a 6-week wait option, choosing a specific hospital network, and considering shared responsibility/co-payment plans.\n\nIt also highlighted that most major providers now offer strong digital GP access and have a growing focus on mental health support, which is often included or available as a comprehensive add-on.\n\nFull disclosure: these insights are from a guide I work on.\n\nFor other small business owners or brokers here, which factor has been most critical in your decision-making: specific cost-saving features like the 6-week wait, the insurer's brand reputation, or the inclusion of wellness and mental health benefits as standard?\n\nhttps://wecovr.com/guides/best-pmi-for-smes-uk-2025?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=rd-community",

      "title": "Neiro (NEIRO) price prediction 2025-2034",
      "selftext": "\u00a0*Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. The crypto market is highly volatile, so always do your own research and follow local regulations before investing.*\n\nThe story of Neiro (NEIRO) has been nothing short of extraordinary, from its emotional connection to Dogecoin\u2019s legacy to becoming a fully community-owned project with a purpose-driven mission. As the meme coin evolves beyond its viral roots, investors and enthusiasts are watching closely to see how it might evolve next. In this article, we take a data-driven look at NEIRO\u2019s price prediction from 2025 to 2034, exploring how various factors could shape its long-term value. Understanding its potential trajectory could help you invest in what might become one of crypto\u2019s most unexpected comeback stories.\n\n# About the Neiro project\n\nr/neiro (NEIRO) is a community-driven cryptocurrency that started as an Ethereum-based meme coin, inspired by a Shiba Inu dog. It was created as a tribute to Neiro, a dog adopted by the owner of Kabosu, the original Doge meme.\n\nNeiro has a strong spirit of collaboration and purpose. After the original creator abandoned it, passionate community members stepped in to keep the project alive. Today, they continue to manage and grow it together under a decentralized model. The Neiro Community Foundation holds the exclusive worldwide license to all Neiro intellectual property, ensuring that the project\u2019s assets and brand remain in the hands of its community.\n\nBeyond crypto, the Neiro community is deeply committed to social good. Guided by the motto \u201cDo Only Good Everyday,\u201d they have donated over $350,000 to charitable causes worldwide, supporting animal welfare, children\u2019s education, and disaster relief efforts.\n\nNeiro has received recognition from several well-known figures in the crypto world, including Vitalik Buterin, Justin Sun, Yi He (co-founder of Binance), and Atsuko Sato. Their acknowledgment highlights the project\u2019s credibility and the positive impact it has within the crypto space.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, NEIRO was the 572nd most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization as of October 26, 2025.\n\n||\n||\n|**Coin Name**|Neiro|\n|**Coin Symbol**|NEIRO|\n|**USD Price**|$0.0002001|\n|**Market Cap**|$84,226,869|\n|**24h Trading Volume**|$19,886,918|\n|**Circulating Supply**|420,690,000,000 NEIRO|\n|**Maximum Supply**|420,690,000,000 NEIRO|\n\n# Founders\n\nThere is no single founder for Neiro crypto; the original deployer abandoned the project, and it is now community-owned. The meme coin was launched by the community after the owner of Kabosu (the dog behind the Doge meme) adopted a new Shiba Inu named Neiro.\n\n# Origin and mission\n\nThe origin of Neiro is deeply rooted in meme coin culture, with a heartfelt back-story that echoes the legend of Dogecoin. After the beloved Shiba Inu known as Kabosu (the original Doge meme dog) passed away, her owner adopted a new Shiba Inu named Neiro. This emotional continuity inspired the launch of NEIRO on the Ethereum network as a tribute and \u201csibling\u201d to Dogecoin\u2019s legacy.\n\nMoreover, the project\u2019s early trajectory featured a developer exit and a subsequent handover to the community, marking Neiro as a genuinely community-owned initiative from its inception.\n\nMission-wise, Neiro aims to go beyond mere meme coin hype by combining culture, community, and cause. It holds the guiding ethos of \u201cDo Only Good Everyday,\u201d channeling the playful spirit of meme culture into real-world action including animal welfare, children\u2019s education, and disaster relief. Governance and ownership rest entirely with the community, i.e., no hidden team allocations, no taxes on buys or sells, ensuring that NEIRO remains aligned with those who hold and support it.\n\nThe result is a purpose-driven coin: one that honors the past, builds with the present community, and gives back in meaningful ways.\n\n# Roadmap and development\n\nAs of now, Neiro\u2019s roadmap emphasizes three principal pillars: charity and real-world impact, intellectual-property (IP) monetization, and ecosystem utility expansion. According to a recent update, the project is scaling its philanthropic efforts into 2025-2026, targeting larger donations to animal welfare and disaster-relief causes worldwide.\n\nParallel to this, Neiro intends to leverage its exclusive IP rights, secured in 2025, by engaging in licensing deals with brands and creators, with the revenue earmarked to support its charity mission.\n\nOn the ecosystem and technical side, the project is preparing to broaden its chain presence and utility. One confirmed step is a partnership with Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) which will enable Neiro to support multi-chain operations beyond just Ethereum and move into chains like Base.\n\nFurther roadmap items include introducing governance mechanisms so that token holders can vote on fund allocations (governance model targeted for Q4 2025) and aiming for additional exchange listings to improve liquidity and market access.\n\nIt is important to note that, while these are the publicly stated milestones, the project does not appear to publish a detailed technical development schedule (e.g., precise dates for smart contract releases or product development milestones). As with many meme coins, execution of the roadmap will depend heavily on community participation, partner engagement, and broader market conditions.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nNeiro has a fixed total supply of 420.69 billion tokens. The token is designed to carry 0% buy tax and 0% sell tax, meaning no transfer fees are required for trading this meme coin on its native network.\n\nThe project emphasizes a fully community-owned model: there are no developer or team token allocations held privately, and the contract ownership has reportedly been renounced so that the community now governs and manages the token. Liquidity has likewise been locked or burned (or at least highly restricted) in order to minimize centralized control and mitigate risk of manipulation.\n\n# Neiro (NEIRO) price history\n\nWhen Neiro first launched in 2024, it entered the market amid the wave of meme coins and enjoyed an initial surge in interest thanks to its connection to the legacy of Kabosu (the dog behind the original meme for Dogecoin) and the marketed community-driven ethos. Its **initial price was $0.000004** on July 31, 2024. On August 1, 2024, Neiro recorded an **all-time low around $0.000002** per token. Later that year, it reached an **all-time high of $0.003** on November 13, 2024.\n\n# Following that peak, the price entered a steep descent through late 2024 and into 2025. This downturn reflects both diminished speculative interest and the broader mood in the meme coin sector. As of October 26, 2025, the token is trading at a significantly lower level of approximately $0.0002.Neiro (NEIRO) price prediction\n\n||\n||\n|**Year**|**Min. price**|**Avg. price**|**Max. price**|**Potential max. ROI**|\n|2025|$0.0004|$0.0008|$0.0012|500%|\n|2026|$0.0006|$0.0012|$0.0018|800%|\n|2028|$0.0013|$0.0026|$0.0039|1,850%|\n|2030|$0.0029|$0.0059|$0.0089|4,350%|\n|2034|$0.0037|$0.0038|$0.0039|1,850%|\n\n# NEIRO price prediction for 2025\n\nShort-term price predictions for this meme coin vary widely. According to CoinLore, NEIRO will trade at an average and maximum of $0.0002 for the year\u2019s remainder. This prediction does not expect any growth in the next couple of months. By contrast, DigitalCoinPrice expects an average and maximum price of $0.0004. Coinpedia is more optimistic, indicating an average price of $0.0008 and a maximum of $0.0012. Considering the last prediction, investing in this asset at the current trading price of $0.0002 might yield a +500% maximum return this year.\n\n# NEIRO price prediction for 2026\n\nCoinLore expects NEIRO to trade at an average and maximum price of $0.0004 in 2026. DigitalCoinPrice predicts an average and maximum price of $0.0005. Coinpedia forecasts an average price of $0.0012 and a maximum of $0.0018. Therefore, a NEIRO investment at the current $0.0002 per token might grow by +800% next year.\n\n# NEIRO price prediction for 2028\n\nCoinLore predicts a maximum NEIRO price of $0.0007 in 2028. DigitalCoinPrice indicates an average and maximum price of $0.0009. In contrast, Coinpedia expects an average price of $0.0026 and a possible maximum of $0.0039. Hence, investing in this meme coin at the current trading price of $0.0002 might yield a +1,850% return by 2028.\n\n# NEIRO price prediction for 2030\n\nCoinLore predicts a maximum NEIRO price of $0.0013 in 2030. DigitalCoinPrice foresees a better scenario, with an average price of $0.0010 and a maximum of $0.0011. In contrast, Coinpedia indicates an average price of $0.0059 and a maximum of $0.0089. Therefore, a NEIRO investment at the current trading price of $0.0002 might increase its value by +4,350% by 2030.\n\n# NEIRO price prediction for 2034\n\nCoinLore expects the NEIRO to trade at a maximum of $0.0029 in 2034. In contrast, DigitalCoinPrice expects an average price of $0.0038 and a maximum of $0.0039. If this occurs, a NEIRO investment at the current $0.0002 per token might yield a +1,850% return by 2034. In other words, the price of this meme coin would return to the level of 2028.\n\n# Growth drivers and risks\n\nNEIRO has drawn attention for its unique origin story and strong community engagement. While it shares the lighthearted, viral energy typical of meme coins, it also distinguishes itself through its charitable mission, decentralized ownership, and ties to the legacy of Dogecoin. However, like all meme-based assets, its long-term trajectory depends on balancing hype with sustained utility and community trust. Below are the key factors that could drive its growth and the challenges it may face along the way.\n\n# Key growth drivers\n\n* **Emotional and cultural legacy:** Neiro\u2019s connection to Kabosu (the original Doge) gives it instant cultural recognition and emotional appeal within the crypto community.\n* **Strong community ownership:** With the deployer gone and control handed to the community, Neiro is governed by its holders, fostering organic engagement and transparency.\n* **Charity and positive social impact:** The \u201cDo Only Good Everyday\u201d ethos and over $350,000 in charitable donations enhance Neiro\u2019s credibility and attract socially conscious supporters.\n* **Influencer recognition:** Endorsements or acknowledgments from figures like Vitalik Buterin, Justin Sun, and Binance co-founder Yi He boost visibility and legitimacy.\n* **Expanding partnerships:** Upcoming integrations, such as with Chainlink\u2019s CCIP and potential cross-chain deployments, may increase accessibility and utility.\n* **Brand licensing potential:** The Neiro Community Foundation holds exclusive IP rights, opening future opportunities for NFT collaborations, merchandise, and digital branding.\n\n# Potential risks and challenges\n\n* **High volatility:** Like most meme coins, NEIRO\u2019s price history shows extreme fluctuations, with sharp rises and steep declines.\n* **Limited utility:** Despite plans for expansion, this token\u2019s current use cases remain mostly symbolic and community-driven, not functional.\n* **Dependence on community momentum:** With no central leadership or team allocations, sustained growth relies on consistent volunteer participation and enthusiasm.\n* **Market saturation:** The meme coin sector is crowded, making it difficult for any single token to maintain long-term attention.\n* **Speculative trading behavior:** A large portion of meme coin volume comes from short-term speculation, increasing the risk of rapid sell-offs.\n* **Regulatory uncertainty:** As global scrutiny on crypto intensifies, meme coins without clear utility could face compliance or exchange-listing challenges.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nThe value of NEIRO as an investment depends largely on an individual\u2019s risk tolerance and investment strategy. The project\u2019s community-driven nature, emotional connection to the legacy of Dogecoin, and charitable focus provide a foundation for potential growth if market sentiment toward meme coins turns positive again. However, its nearly year-long price decline highlights how volatile and speculative this type of asset can be. This meme coin\u2019s future will likely depend on renewed community momentum, broader market recovery, and successful execution of its plans for cross-chain expansion and utility development.\n\nPrice forecasts for NEIRO remain divided, reflecting both optimism and uncertainty about its long-term potential. While most projections lean positive, and some even appear overly bullish in the short term, there is no clear consensus on when or if the meme coin might recover to previous highs. For traders willing to embrace volatility, NEIRO could offer short-term profit opportunities amid market fluctuations. Still, prospective investors should conduct careful research before entering any position, keeping in mind that meme coins can deliver rapid gains but also equally swift losses.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# Is NEIRO a good investment?\n\nNEIRO can be considered a speculative but potentially rewarding short-term investment, depending on market conditions and investor sentiment. Some analysts expect notable gains in the coming years as the project continues to grow its community and visibility. The current price level could offer an attractive entry point for those seeking early exposure to a meme coin with cultural relevance and charitable initiatives. However, like all assets in the meme coin sector, NEIRO\u2019s performance is highly unpredictable, and investors should approach it with caution and proper risk management.\n\n# Is it wise to invest in meme coins like NEIRO?\n\nInvesting in meme coins such as NEIRO carries substantial risk due to their extreme volatility and speculative nature. Although NEIRO stands out for its strong community ownership and endorsements from prominent crypto figures, it lacks extensive real-world utility, which makes its price heavily dependent on market trends and online attention. Investors with a high risk tolerance may find opportunities for impressive gains during bullish phases, but sudden downturns are equally possible. As with all speculative assets, it is best to invest only what you can afford to lose and to diversify your portfolio to reduce overall exposure.\n\n# Why has the price of NEIRO dropped in the previous months?\n\nNEIRO experienced a sharp decline after reaching its all-time high of approximately $0.003 on November 13, 2024. This correction followed an intense period of hype and trading volume typical of meme coins, where early excitement often leads to profit-taking and rapid sell-offs. Broader market conditions and reduced interest in speculative tokens also contributed to the downward trend. Despite this, the Neiro community remains active, and future developments or market recoveries could influence its price trajectory.\n\n# When will NEIRO reach a new all-time high?\n\nForecasts vary depending on the analytical source and market assumptions. According to Coinpedia, NEIRO could potentially reach a new all-time high as early as 2028, while other analysts predict that this milestone might take longer, possibly into the next crypto market cycle. Much of this will depend on the project\u2019s ability to maintain community engagement, expand its utility, and benefit from favorable overall market trends. As with all long-term predictions, these estimates should be viewed as speculative rather than guaranteed outcomes.\n\n# Should I invest in NEIRO?\n\nThe decision to invest in NEIRO ultimately depends on your financial goals, risk appetite, and belief in the project\u2019s vision. It may deliver significant returns over the next few years if its community remains strong and market conditions turn bullish again. However, like most meme coins, it is also highly susceptible to sharp declines once interest wanes or liquidity drops. Investors should conduct their own research, stay updated on project developments, and only invest funds they can comfortably afford to risk.\n\n# Where can I get NEIRO?\n\nYou can get NEIRO on LetsExchange, where you can trade it at competitive rates without mandatory registration. The process is straightforward: choose the token you want to swap, select NEIRO as your target asset, and complete the exchange securely. Your acquired assets will be sent to your wallet. Keeping your NEIRO in a non-custodial wallet is recommended for better control and security.",

I tried an amazfit brand but the watch was pretty laggy and would constantly turn on the face at night while sleeping, despite turning off various settings.   \nWould a lower end garmin a galaxy fe smartwatch be worth a go or are there other brands that are a little less known?

      "title": "Transcript of Auxly's presentation at Investor Conference",
      "selftext": "A transcript of Auxly's presentation at the \n\nPlanetMicroCap conference:  \n  \nHopefully after reading it, you'll understand why I'm so excited about the opportunity.   \n  \nThe questions weren't picked up on the mic but the answers are all here:  \n  \nHugo Alves  \n  \nThank you. Is this on? We're good? All right. First, thank you very much for your time today and for your interest in Auxly. My name is Hugo Alves and I'm the Co-Founder and CEO of Auxly. Maybe before we begin, I'll give you a few introductory remarks about myself. I've been in regulated cannabis since the beginning, since the regs were introduced in 2013. Before Auxly, at that time I was a Senior Partner at Bennett Jones, a national law firm where I practiced regulatory and commercial law, and my team really helped structure a lot of the early deals in cannabis as companies were just starting to become capitalized.  \n  \nIn my journey in cannabis, through Auxly and Bennett Jones, I've also been fortunate to play a role in the evolution of cannabis policy in this country, most recently as the Chair of the Cannabis Industry Forum, which was an economic and industry advisory panel to the federal government. I'm passionate about cannabis, I'm passionate about the cannabis industry, and most of all, I'm passionate about Auxly. I'm delighted to be here today to tell you a little bit more about our company and why we're excited for the future. Maybe before, you know, please note our standard disclaimers here on forward-looking information and the use of non-IFRS measures. Auxly, at a glance, we are a publicly traded Canadian cannabis company headquartered here in Toronto. We trade on the TSX and the OTCQB exchanges. We're a strong and passionate team, 410 team members strong.  \n  \nWe specialize in the cultivation and manufacturing of cannabis products that we sell here in Canada under a portfolio of owned brands. We're currently the third largest producer of cannabis products by market share, 6.2% share of total market. **Our flagship brand, Back Forty, is the number one brand in cannabis by dollars sold.** It is trusted and loved by consumers from coast to coast. You can find our products in 97% of all retail locations because we focus on the product categories that matter the most: dried flower, pre-rolls, and vapes. That's what we're great at. Those three product formats collectively account for about 90% of all market sales. Most importantly, I'm very proud to say that Auxly is a cannabis company that is growing profitably. We've delivered strong top-line growth since 2020 when we started commercial sales, 60% CAGR.  \n  \nMore recently, as at Q2 over the trailing 12 months, we've generated CAD 139 million in net operating revenue, CAD 38 million in adjusted EBITDA, and CAD 28 million of net income. We're excited about where we've gotten the company to and where it's going to go in the future. We think that we're in an excellent spot to continue delivering year-over-year growth and strong profitable results. You start with the Canadian market where we operate. This is a growing market. More and more Canadians are choosing cannabis as their preferred form of recreation. More and more of those consumers are choosing to purchase their cannabis from safe, regulated sources like Auxly, as opposed to the dangerous, illicit market. It is a growing market. Demand for our products is at an all-time high, continuing to grow. Not only is it a growing market, it's a stable market.  \n  \nAs weaker players have exited the market, some have converted to an asset-light model and others have focused outside of the country. **That has created better pricing dynamics for producers like us**. We are getting a better price for our product. We expect those dynamics to continue given that we are in a strong demand environment and the capital cost and time, if you can raise the capital to bring quality cultivation online. We're excited about Canada and the growth potential here. Beyond Canada, there's an international market that continues to grow and evolve and provides Auxly with a bigger market to grow into. I want to be clear, our focus is to win at home. We have always said there's got to be a reason to believe that you can compete internationally. Our vision as a company is to be a global leader.  \n  \nWe think we're very well positioned to execute on that vision, first and foremost because we are winning at home. We are making brands and products consumers genuinely trust and love. The assets and capabilities that we've developed, which I'll talk about in a minute, give us real advantages that position us to continue winning at home and competing on a global scale when the time is right, including we have a strategic partnership with Imperial Brands. They're our largest shareholder. They own 19.9% of our business, so very aligned with our success. For those of you who may be not as familiar with Imperial Brands, they're the world's fourth largest tobacco company and one of the world's truly global CPG companies. They operate in over 120 different countries, including all of the countries that have a pathway to legalization. They are our strategic partner and largest shareholder.  \n  \n**They will help us grow into those markets when the time is right**. I also talked about our assets. I think our assets, our purpose-built strategic assets, give us a real edge in terms of cost and quality. I'll start with Auxly Leamington. This is our 1.1 million square foot cannabis cultivation facility located in Leamington, Ontario, currently producing about 100,000 kg of high-quality dried flowers. **This is one of the largest and most advanced cannabis cultivation facilities on the planet.** We designed and built this facility in partnership with one of the largest greenhouse manufacturers in North America. Every single aspect of this facility is purpose-built for cannabis. We believe that this gives us a real advantage in terms of sale and cost without sacrificing quality.  \n  \n**We think we're the lowest cost or one of the lowest cost producers in the cannabis industry**, but low cost alone is not going to be very meaningful if consistency and quality suffer. That is where Auxly Leamington really shines because this facility consistently produces high quality, high potency cannabis that consumers love and the fruit is in the result. Back Forty is the number one brand. Back Forty is the number one brand in dried flower. As a flower brand, it is growing at 91% on a rolling 12-month basis. Our two most popular SKUs, **our Back Forty Liquid Imagination and Fire Breath 28 g bags, are respectively the number one and number two top selling SKU total market**. Auxly Leamington delivers on flower, and Auxly Leamington also houses our automated pre-roll capabilities where, again, our approach is much the same as in flower. Consistently deliver high quality at scale.  \n  \nThrough our partnership with Imperial Brands and a five-year R&D collaboration with the world's largest manufacturer of high-throughput tobacco equipment, **we have developed the most advanced high-speed cannabis pre-roll filling and packaging capabilities in the industry** and unrivaled operational and technical knowledge. This allows us to consistently deliver a high quality of product while giving us scale and cost advantages in pre-rolls, one of the most important consumer categories in cannabis today and for the future. Our focus on pre-roll and these capabilities have yielded excellent results to date. Our Back Forty slims have become a national consumer favorite, propelling Back Forty to be the number one brand in non-infused pre-rolls. **In fact, out of the top 10 non-infused pre-roll SKUs total market, five of them are a Back Forty slims product**. Back Forty as a pre-roll brand is growing at a rate of 41% on a rolling 12-month basis.  \n  \nWe are starting to innovate into larger formats, into infused formats, to continue winning category share like we did this summer with the introduction of our Back Forty Backpackers product, which is a larger size pre-roll. **We introduced it in the summer. It was a tremendous success, exceeded our expectations**. We are excited about our ability to continue growing in pre-rolls. Going to vapes, you get to Auxly Charlottetown, our center of vapor innovation and manufacturing located in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. We got to PEI because of the deep talent pool in science and biotechnology. The PEI government has worked really hard over the last decade and a half to promote the biotech sector, and they have done an incredible job in attracting some of the world's top biotech companies and talent to the province. We have been able to assemble an incredible team at Auxly Charlottetown.  \n  \nI think they are unmatched in terms of cannabis vapor innovation in this country. They have released more first-to-market vape innovations than any other team, including last year when they introduced the all-in-one vape to the Canadian cannabis market and really changed the face of the vape category. **The all-in-one vapes are now one of the fastest growing, most popular segments in cannabis, and Back Forty dominates there. 23% share of segment**, over 10,000 points of national distribution, really showing the popularity of these products. As a vape brand, Back Forty has always been one of the top vape brands. That's where we got our start day one. Continues to grow at a rate of 30% on a rolling 12-month basis.  \n  \nAuxly Charlottetown delivers again on innovation, and we are going to continue to lean into our culture of innovation because it is that combination of innovation leadership in our core categories plus operational excellence that helps drive our strong gross margins and financial results. Whether it's the next great cultivar, pre-roll, or vape, our culture of data-driven consumer insights and innovation ensures that we stay focused on what matters most and that we continue to evolve and grow with our consumers, bring great new products to market, and winning market share. I'll recap here just for a second. We think that our strong product focus, we focused on the right products coupled with the assets and capabilities I just discussed and the fact that we operate in a growing market, gives us a lot of confidence that we can continue to deliver strong financial results.  \n  \nMost recently, we delivered our Q2 2025 financials up until the end of June, and it was a record quarter. CAD 38.8 million in net revenue, a 33% increase year over year. We expanded gross margins to 52%, which was 11 percentage points better than the previous year and obviously had a great impact on EBITDA with CAD 11.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 123% improvement over the previous year, and translated into a 30% EBITDA margin. We're delighted with the year-over-year improvements. **Those year-over-year gains were driven by improvements in our throughput and quality at our facilities, which we funded organically through our own cash flows**, increased demand for our products, innovation and product mix, and of course, some of the better pricing that I alluded to earlier.  \n  \nQ2 was also fantastic on the bottom line, CAD 8.3 million of net income, and we generated about CAD 4 million of cash flow from operations. It was a strong CPG-like performance, and we think the company's in a really good spot to continue growing and enjoying strong operating leverage. **Given our largely fixed cost base, continued improvements in revenue should flow largely to our bottom line**. We're mindful of the fact, and we believe that EBITDA is not as meaningful unless it's converting to cash flow. As at the end of Q2 over the 12-month period, **we've generated about CAD 21.5 million of cash flow on CAD 38 million of EBITDA.** That's converting to a very healthy 56% conversion rate of EBITDA to cash flow. The company is generating significant cash flows to help fund our future growth. Importantly, immediately subsequent to quarter, we recapitalized and transformed our balance sheet.  \n  \nWe're excited to show the impact of that on our Q3 print. With strong support from our lending syndicate led by BMO and our strategic partner Imperial Brands, we eliminated CAD 21 million of debt from our balance sheet. We reduced our debt servicing cost by about CAD 700,000 a year. Importantly, we flipped our working capital from a working capital deficit to about CAD 35 million in pro forma working capital. It was transformative, and it gives us a strong, flexible balance sheet where we can now start allocating capital to opportunities that will improve our business, generate a very strong return, and create enduring shareholder value. I'm going to wrap it up there. If it hasn't gotten across, we're excited. We're excited about the future of the company. We really do believe we are just getting started. We operate in a growing market.  \n  \nWe believe we focused on the right products and developed assets that give us real strategic advantages. I think the proof is in the results. The company is growing profitably. We're generating strong cash flows. **Now with the recapitalized balance sheet, we have the flexibility to start allocating capital to high return opportunities**. We're excited. The executive leadership team is excited. We're a small team, six individuals. We've all been with the company either as founders or day one early employees. We've stuck together and navigated the well-documented headwinds of the Canadian cannabis industry. We're battle-hardened. I think what you can expect from us is we're going to continue to prioritize profitability and cash flow, and we're going to be very prudent with the allocation of our capital and make sure it's going to our best and highest return opportunities. I'll stop there.  \n  \nThank you again for your time and interest in Auxly. I know we have some time left, so I'm happy to answer any questions now. I look forward to meeting as many of you as I can over the next day and a half. Thank you.  \n  \n1.1 million square feet at Leamington, how much of that is actually growing in the space?  \n  \n660,000 square feet. 660.  \n  \nOf your 100 kg, the kilos that you grow, how much of that is used for your actual products and how much do you sell off?  \n  \n85/15 split is what we target. 85% B2C, 15% B2B.  \n  \nSo 85%?  \n  \n85% goes into our own brands, our own branded products. We will use more of that. We prioritize B2C. We prioritize the building of our brands, but we do participate in the B2B market.  \n  \nSell off?  \n  \nYeah, look, I would say when you're thinking about our capacity, we're at 100,000 kgs a year dried. This year we improved output by about 10% on a very capital-light basis. We're about CAD 2.5 million of CapEx this year. We believe there continue to be lots of capital-light ways for us to get similar improvements year over year for the next few years, improving yields by 8%- 10%. I don't look at it that way. I think that there are probably four large-scale cultivation facilities in Canada that are in the same league as Auxly Leamington. They focus, I've been in all of them, they focus on different things. They've spent money in different places. Again, where Auxly Leamington, I think, shines is it's been purpose-built from the ground up to be nothing but a cannabis facility and with a really strong focus on quality. Right?  \n  \n**We're not really a greenhouse. It's more, the HVAC controls in this facility are equivalent to any indoor facility.** Where we get is scale and cost advantages. Given the scale, given the yields that we're able to get without compromising quality, like I said, low-cost product is great, but not if you want to be number one in dried flower, not if you want to win with consumers. So far, yeah. Thanks, Kirk.  \n  \nWhat did you do for your cannabis?  \n  \nWe refinanced. It was kind of like, think of it as a two-stage transaction. Part of it involved Imperial Brands. Part of it involved our senior lending syndicate. With Imperial Brands, our strategic partner, **we effectively gave them CAD 9 million of equity and they, for CAD 21 million. They wrote off part of the debt and the rest they converted into effectively like an anti-dilution instrument. It's a paid-up warrant.** On the back, it was the remainder of the debt that they put in by way of investment. They converted CAD 123 million last year into equity, and this was the remaining picked interest that wasn't converted at that time. On the back of that support, BMO restructured our loan.  \n  \nInside of?  \n  \nInside, so Imperial owns about 19.9% to be exact, and then management owns 5%- 7%. Capital light, capital light, yeah. Capacity on pre-rolls, lots of capacity, right? **We have three high-speed makers. Let's say two of them are, you know, we were the first to have them, but they're commercially available now. The large-speed one is the only one of its kind. It was just specifically designed for us.** We have lots of throughput in pre-rolls. Again, in cultivation, we don't have a part of the facility that's off because we don't need it. We use the entire space. Where we can continue to make improvements is in post-harvest, right? That is usually the bottleneck to capacity growth, right? It's a mix of your processes and your genetics that you're using. There's a host of factors that go into it.  \n  \nLike I said, we think we can increase output by 8%- 10% on a year-over-year basis for the next few years without announcing a major CapEx project like some of our competitors have. Yeah, Kirk, go ahead. Auxly Leamington, I don't know if I have a, like a, yeah, I don't have a picture of it here, but it's, so first think of it as it sits on a 100-acre parcel of owned land. That is kind of what boxes you in from a real property perspective. We have dedicated allocation of power. We're a Class A rate payer. We don't pay the global adjustment that, unfortunately, all Ontario energy users pay. We have our own dedicated line.  \n  \nThat was part of one of the reasons why we chose Leamington, this parcel had a new transmission line being built right next to it and had an allocation of 25 MW available to it. Having the power is also a big gating factor to expansion. 100 acres, got a lot of power. **This facility was designed, the blueprints have another 660,000 square feet of glass**, right? It was supposed to have, if you ever see a picture, it looks like an L shape. It was supposed to have the other half built in. We saw, as a two and a half year capital project, demand dynamics shifting dramatically. We were able to sort of halt construction of that second half of glass. A lot of the parts are, you know, we weren't able to stop all of the deliveries and stuff.  \n  \nA lot of the parts, like the moving tables and stuff, are there. If you wanted to do a major CapEx project to significantly increase, you could double, more than double yields on that 660. Beyond that, you're into building more glass on your real property parcel. Theoretically, you could build another 660 and then another two of those facilities because the full envelope is 30 acres and we sit on a 100-acre parcel.  \n  \nIs that CAD 50 million?  \n  \nWe would have to price it out, right? It'd be irresponsible of me to give you a range. I would say, you know, GrowCo, which is Cronos's JV facility in Leamington, Ontario, and not dissimilar in size than us. They just announced, you know, major expansion. It was about CAD 70 million that they quoted, right? We haven't priced out that type of expansion because, you know, frankly, again, we believe that we can increase output, you know, being a lot more conservative with our cash flow. We're also mindful of the fact that we don't want to get out ahead of our skis in terms of supply. We are now in a better supply-demand environment, but that is relatively new, right? That is over the last year. Before that, we were in an oversupply environment.  \n  \nFrankly, we're going to be prudent with the allocation of our capital, make sure that we are going to get a good return on it. Yeah, great question. Look, I think we are still looking at all the opportunities. I think we are going to prioritize, I think, some continued improvements, like capital improvements, because that yields very strong returns and increases profitability. We'd also like to continue improving our balance sheet. **We have a final piece of high-interest debt coming due at the end of this month. It's about a 20% cost of capital piece of debt. We're evaluating paying that out with our cash flows now**. Beyond that, we have a host of opportunities that, again, we think yield very good returns for our shareholders and improve our business. Too early to comment on that now. Yes. It would be improvements.  \n  \nNo, we're not going to go, you know, like, no, no, no, we're going to be, look, like I said, we've been at this now since the beginning. It's been a tough industry, right? There's been a lot of ebbs and flows, a lot of headwinds. **We're excited that we've gotten the company into this position where it's profitable, generating strong cash flows, but we are going to be prudent going forward. We're not going to start spending aggressively.** The facility is CUMCS-certified. That's the Israeli certification. It's the equivalent of a GACP registration. We can ship internationally to non-EU GMP countries directly, to GACP countries. In GMP countries, we would need to use a third party to finish drying the product and packaging in GMP. That is, in terms of opportunities that we're looking at of where to allocate capital, very much on the agenda, right?  \n  \nThere have been changes in the GMP licensing regime over the last six months. I think companies that have had their GMP license renewal audits have been quite surprised. It's something that we continue to look at. On the international front, this is an evolving regulatory environment, right? We are going to be prudent. We're going to make sure that we have full transparency and understand what we're doing because there is overlap, right? There would be overlap in a capital project to EU GMP something and to improve output and quality at our facility. We want to make sure we get it right. Any other questions? No? Okay. Listen, thank you very much. Look forward to meeting you. Thanks for the time.",

      "selftext": "Hello all!\nI am shopping around for a new vehicle to upgrade from my Civic. I am looking for something a little more capable although I do not go off-roading, just some light trails in the desert for shooting and whatnot. They are too much for the Civic but any crossover/SUB/truck will make it just fine.\nI have narrowed it down to three options:\n1. 2020 4Runner 48k miles\n I am a GM technician and I am getting a great discount on this used 4Runner that is on our lot, but it has no warranty and I enjoy the piece of mind that comes with warranty even though I am a mechanic. (parts are expensive!) I would probably purchase an aftermarket service contract with it even though it is known as a reliable vehicle but they won\u2019t let me do my own repairs with the warranty so I\u2019ll have to have a buddy do it. \n\n2. 2024 GMC Canyon 18k miles\nThis one is CPO and I am able to perform my own repairs under this warranty. Downside is it is GM junk, so the longevity is not there, it will probably need major engine and transmission work around 100k or less. Upside is I know them well. I love driving these little trucks and I love the interior. I hate that it is a piece of crap at the end of the day but hey, warranty!\nI would get paid to fix it on the clock! Plus I get discounts on all the GM parts, accessories, and maintenance items. \n\n3. 2025 Toyota Rav 4 XLE Brand New\nThis one meets all of my needs but doesn\u2019t have the \u201ctruck factor\u201d for me. I like how they look but at the same time I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a \u201ccool\u201d vehicle, but more so a smart and stylish choice. It has the added benefit of great MPG like my Civic but it isn\u2019t a top priority as I don\u2019t drive that much. I understand that is is the best daily driver of the three.\n\nAt the end of the day the 4 Runner is what I have wanted since high school (2014) \nBut I also would enjoy the warranty and having the ability to do all my own work during that period on the Canyon\nI feel like either Toyota is a much better financial choice though. \nThoughts?",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone\n\nBlack Friday Laptop Deals 2025 is just around the corner (November 28, to be exact), and with it comes a tidal wave of laptop discounts that can save you hundreds on your next machine. But amid the hype, not every \"deal\" is a winner. This guide cuts through the noise with timeless, practical advice on how to choose a good laptop during the sales frenzy.

No specific product plugs here - just the tools to make informed decisions for students, pros, gamers, or casual users.\n\nIn 2025, expect deals on AI-enhanced laptops with chips like Intel Core Ultra or AMD Ryzen AI series, but remember: the best buy matches your workflow, not the flashiest specs.

Factor in 10-20% extra for accessories like cases or docks.\n* **Make a Wishlist:** List must-haves (e.g., 16GB RAM for multitasking) and browse retailer sites now to track prices.\n\n**Step 2: Prioritize Key Specs for Value**\n\nDeals shine when specs align with performance needs. In 2025, focus on future-proof elements like efficient AI processors and fast SSDs. Here's a breakdown by budget tier. aim for at least these baselines to avoid buyer's remorse.\n\n|Budget Tier|Processor (CPU)|RAM/Storage|Display & Battery|Ideal For|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Under $700**|Entry-mid (e.g., Intel Core i3/Ultra 5, AMD Ryzen 3/5)|8GB/256GB SSD|1080p, 6-8 hours|Students, browsing, light productivity.|\n|**$700-$1,200**|Mid-range (Intel Core i5/Ultra 7, AMD Ryzen 5/7)|16GB/512GB SSD|1080p-2K, 8-12 hours|Work, streaming, basic editing.|\n|**Over $1,200**|High-end (Intel Core i7/Ultra 9, AMD Ryzen 7/9)|16-32GB/1TB+ SSD|OLED/120Hz+, 10+ hours|Gaming, creators, pros.|\n\n* **Other Must-Haves:** Dedicated GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 40/50-series) for gaming; Wi-Fi 6E/7 for connectivity; 1080p webcam for hybrid work. For portability, seek aluminum builds and 13-14\" screens.\n* **OS Choice:** Windows for gaming versatility; macOS for battery sips and ecosystem lock-in; ChromeOS for budget web tasks.\n\n**Step 3: Smart Strategies for Snagging Deals**\n\nBlack Friday isn't just about the lowest price, it's about value. Expect 20-40% off last-gen models as retailers clear inventory for 2026 refreshes.\n\n* **Shop Trusted Retailers:** Hit Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Newegg, or brand sites (Dell, HP, Lenovo) for wide selection. Official stores often bundle extras like mice or warranties.\n* **Timing is Key:** Early bird sales start November 24; Cyber Monday (Dec 1) favors online exclusives.

Here's how to dodge duds:\n\n* **Check MSRP Reality:** Use tools like Google Shopping to confirm original prices. beware inflated \"list\" prices padded for fake discounts.\n* **New vs. Refurbished:** If opting for open-box, ensure seller certification; otherwise, stick to new for peace of mind.\n* **Read the Fine Print:** Scan for underpowered configs (e.g., soldered RAM you can't upgrade) or third-party sellers with sketchy returns.\n* Cross-reference user reviews and benchmarks, A \"deal\" on outdated tech (pre-2024 CPUs) isn't worth it.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nNailing a Black Friday 2025 laptop deal means blending prep, specs smarts, and savvy shopping. No FOMO required. Top picks? A mid-range all-rounder for most, but tailor to your world. With clearances on 2025 models incoming, now's prime time to gear up. What's your budget or top spec worry?

      "title": "BitBrowser vs. Multilogin: Why Paying 3x More Doesn't Mean 3x Better Results",
      "selftext": "When shopping for anti-detect browsers, you'll inevitably encounter Multilogin\u2014the industry veteran that's been setting standards since 2015. With its premium reputation comes premium pricing: plans start at \u20ac9 ($9.50) monthly for just 10 profiles and quickly scale to \u20ac79 ($83) monthly for 100 profiles. Meanwhile, BitBrowser offers 50 profiles for $10 monthly, with a permanent free plan supporting 10 profiles. That's a price difference of 700-800% for comparable functionality.\n\nThe question isn't whether Multilogin is good\u2014it absolutely is. The question is whether paying 3-8 times more delivers proportional value, especially when BitBrowser provides nearly identical core functionality at a fraction of the cost. After extensive testing and comparison, we've found that for most users, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nLet's dig into the details.\n\n# The Price Reality: What You're Actually Paying\n\nBefore diving into features, let's establish the concrete cost difference because it's substantial:\n\n# Multilogin Pricing (2025)Pro 10: \u20ac9/month (\u20ac5.85 annual) \u2013 10 profiles, 1GB proxies\n\n* **Pro 50:** \u20ac43/month (\u20ac35.10 annual) \u2013 50 profiles, 3GB proxies\n* **Pro 100:** \u20ac79/month (\u20ac51.35 annual) \u2013 100 profiles, 5GB proxies\n* **Business 300:** \u20ac159/month \u2013 300 profiles, unlimited team seats, 10GB proxies\n* **Trial:** \u20ac1.99 for 3 days, 5 profiles\n\n# [BitBrowser ](https://www.bitbrowser.net/)Pricing (2025)Free Plan: Permanent \u2013 10 profiles, 50 launches/day, 1 team member\n\n* **Base Plan:** $10/month \u2013 50 profiles, unlimited launches\n* **Custom Plans:** Available for larger operations\n* **Trial:** Free forever with 10 profiles\n\n**The Cost Breakdown**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9to9ciweuxf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62cce8ca1b5833b8b457ab934e4a174c7cce382b\n\nLet's compare apples to apples for a small business needing 50-100 profiles:\n\n**For 50 Profiles:**\n\n* Multilogin: \u20ac43/month (\u20ac516/year) or \u20ac35.10/month annual (\u20ac421/year)\n* BitBrowser: $10/month ($120/year)\n* **Savings with BitBrowser: $301-396 annually (71-77% less)**\n\n**For 100 Profiles:**\n\n* Multilogin: \u20ac79/month (\u20ac948/year) or \u20ac51.35/month annual (\u20ac616/year)\n* BitBrowser: Approximately $20-30/month ($240-360/year based on custom pricing)\n* **Savings with BitBrowser: $256-588 annually (42-71% less)**\n\nThat's not a small difference. For a marketing agency or e-commerce operation, these savings could fund an entire proxy subscription or additional team member salaries.\n\n# Feature Comparison: Where Multilogin Wins (And Where It Doesn't Matter)\n\n**Fingerprinting Technology**\n\n**Multilogin's Approach:** Multilogin uses proprietary browser engines (Mimic for Chromium, Stealthfox for Firefox) that completely spoof fingerprints rather than just modifying parameters. The company conducts daily testing across 50+ websites and claims 95%+ undetection rates. This represents the absolute pinnacle of fingerprinting technology.\n\n**BitBrowser's Approach:** BitBrowser modifies fingerprint parameters including User Agent, Canvas, WebGL, Audio, Fonts, Timezone, WebRTC, and dozens of other identifiers. It supports both Chrome and Firefox kernels and allows deep customization of system-level characteristics.\n\n**The Reality:** For 90% of use cases\u2014managing Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, eBay, TikTok accounts\u2014BitBrowser's fingerprinting performs identically to Multilogin's. Both create isolated environments that platforms cannot link. The 5-10% advantage Multilogin offers matters primarily for extremely sophisticated detection systems or when operating at massive scale (1000+ accounts).\n\nUnless you're managing high-value financial accounts or operating in heavily monitored industries, you're paying premium prices for marginal improvements you'll never notice.\n\n**Winner: Multilogin by 10%, but BitBrowser delivers 90% of the value**\n\n\n\n# Automation and Workflow Tools\n\n**Multilogin:**\n\n* API access (50-100 requests per minute depending on plan)\n* Selenium, Puppeteer, Playwright support\n* AI-powered automation commands (limited to paid plans)\n* Cookie management and import/export\n\n**BitBrowser:**\n\n* Full API access with local API server\n* Selenium and Puppeteer integration\n* RPA (Robotic Process Automation) recorder that learns workflows\n* No-code automation through workflow templates\n* Script Market for community-created automation scripts\n* Group Control System for synchronous multi-window operations\n* Batch operations for profile management\n\n**The Reality:** BitBrowser actually surpasses Multilogin in automation capabilities. The RPA recorder allows non-technical users to automate complex workflows by simply performing actions once\u2014the system records and replicates them automatically. The Group Control System enables simultaneous control of multiple browser windows, perfect for batch operations across accounts.\n\nMultilogin's AI commands are innovative but require technical knowledge and careful prompt construction. BitBrowser's visual automation is more accessible and practical for most users.\n\n**Winner: BitBrowser \u2013 More features, easier to use, no technical expertise required**\n\n\n\n# Built-in Proxy Services\n\n**Multilogin:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6k2n5i5fuxf1.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=75847fb40b0ada0bdefaa7839b45e92428da4845\n\n* Includes residential proxy traffic with all plans\n* 1GB (Pro 10) to 10GB (Business) monthly\n* Additional traffic at \u20ac3/GB\n* 150+ countries coverage\n* Automatic proxy-fingerprint location matching\n\n**BitBrowser:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5opkcc6fuxf1.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=34a67bb292f8a0a9fde578b75594ebf28df82982\n\n* No built-in proxies\n* Requires external proxy provider\n* Supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5 protocols\n* Proxy manager for bulk import/assignment\n\n**The Reality:** This is Multilogin's clearest advantage. Built-in residential proxies eliminate configuration hassle and potential fingerprint-proxy location mismatches. However, let's do the math:\n\nPremium residential proxies typically cost $3-5 per GB from quality providers. If you need 5GB monthly:\n\n* External proxy cost: $15-25/month\n* Multilogin Pro 100 with 5GB: \u20ac79/month ($83)\n* BitBrowser Base + External 5GB proxies: $10 + $20 = $30/month\n* **You're still saving $53 monthly ($636 annually)**\n\nEven accounting for proxy costs, BitBrowser remains dramatically cheaper while delivering the same end result.\n\n**Winner: Multilogin for convenience, but BitBrowser + external proxies still costs far less**\n\n\n\n# Team Collaboration Features\n\n**Multilogin:**\n\n* Cloud and local profile storage\n* Encrypted cloud sync\n* Up to 10 team members (Pro plans)\n* Unlimited team members (Business plan)\n* Role-based permissions\n* Profile sharing and transfer\n\n**BitBrowser:**\n\n* Cloud synchronization in real-time\n* Team member management\n* Bulk profile sharing and permissions\n* Folder organization and tagging\n* Profile import/export for team distribution\n* Group-based access control\n\n**The Reality:** Both platforms offer robust team collaboration. Multilogin provides slightly more granular permission controls, but BitBrowser covers all essential team needs: profile sharing, access management, cloud sync, and organizational tools.\n\nFor small-to-medium teams (2-10 people), the differences are negligible. BitBrowser's tagging and folder system actually makes large-scale organization more intuitive.\n\n**Winner: Tie \u2013 Both handle team collaboration excellently**\n\n# Mobile Support and Device Emulation\n\n**Multilogin:**\n\n* Android profile emulation\n* Mobile fingerprint customization\n* iOS profile support\n* No mobile app for managing profiles\n\n**BitBrowser:**\n\n* Chrome and Firefox kernel support\n* ChromeOS extension (unique offering)\n* Desktop-focused with mobile fingerprint options\n* No dedicated mobile app\n\n**The Reality:** Multilogin has superior mobile emulation, particularly for iOS. If your business heavily relies on mobile-first platforms like TikTok or Instagram mobile apps, Multilogin's Android/iOS profiles provide more authentic emulation.\n\nHowever, most anti-detect browser users operate via desktop interfaces accessing web versions of platforms. For this majority use case, BitBrowser performs equivalently.\n\n**Winner: Multilogin for mobile-heavy operations, BitBrowser for standard desktop workflows**\n\n\n\n# Interface and User Experience\n\n**Multilogin:**\n\n* Clean, modern web interface\n* Intuitive profile creation wizard\n* Quick-start guides and documentation\n* Streamlined for non-technical users\n* Some users report limited customization options\n\n**BitBrowser:**\n\n* Feature-rich interface with numerous options\n* Steeper learning curve initially\n* Extensive customization capabilities\n* More buttons and settings visible\n* Better for power users who want control\n\n**The Reality:** This is subjective but important. Multilogin's interface is undeniably more polished and beginner-friendly. You can create a profile in under 60 seconds without understanding fingerprinting concepts.\n\nBitBrowser's interface shows more complexity upfront\u2014you see all available parameters and settings. This appears overwhelming at first but becomes an advantage once familiar. Power users appreciate immediate access to advanced settings without navigating through multiple menus.\n\nFirst-time users might prefer Multilogin's simplicity. Experienced users managing hundreds of profiles often prefer BitBrowser's direct access and bulk operation tools.\n\n**Winner: Multilogin for beginners, BitBrowser for experienced users**\n\n\n\n# Support and Documentation\n\n**Multilogin:**\n\n* 24/7 customer support in 5 languages\n* Comprehensive knowledge base\n* Active Telegram community\n* Video tutorials and guides\n* Live chat with quick response times\n\n**BitBrowser:**\n\n* Support primarily during Asian business hours\n* Growing English documentation\n* User manual covering software, RPA, and API\n* Community script sharing\n* Email and ticket-based support\n\n**The Reality:** Multilogin offers superior support infrastructure, particularly for Western users. The 24/7 multilingual support and rapid response times justify some of the premium pricing.\n\nBitBrowser's support, while adequate, operates primarily in Asian time zones. English documentation has improved but remains less comprehensive. For users who need hand-holding or operate in complex enterprise environments, Multilogin's support advantage is meaningful.\n\n**Winner: Multilogin \u2013 Significantly better support infrastructure**\n\n\n\n# Real-World Testing: Does Price Equal Performance?\n\nWe conducted practical tests managing multiple accounts across popular platforms to see if Multilogin's premium pricing delivers tangibly better results:\n\n# Test Parameters\n\n* **Platforms Tested:** Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, eBay, TikTok, Google Ads\n* **Account Numbers:** 50 profiles per platform\n* **Duration:** 90 days\n* **Proxy Setup:** Both browsers used identical residential proxies from the same provider\n* **Activity Level:** Regular daily logins, content posting, purchases, ad management\n\n# Results\n\n**Account Survival Rates:**\n\n* Multilogin: 94% accounts active after 90 days\n* BitBrowser: 91% accounts active after 90 days\n* **Difference: 3% (statistically insignificant for most operations)**\n\n**Detection/Verification Incidents:**\n\n* Multilogin: 12 verification challenges, 6 temporary restrictions\n* BitBrowser: 16 verification challenges, 8 temporary restrictions\n* **Difference: Marginal (4 incidents over 50 accounts)**\n\n**Performance and Stability:**\n\n* Multilogin: Zero crashes, consistent fast loading\n* BitBrowser: 2 crashes over 90 days, occasional slower profile launching\n* **Difference: Multilogin more stable but not dramatically**\n\n# Conclusion from Testing\n\nBoth browsers successfully maintained multiple accounts across major platforms. Multilogin showed slightly better detection avoidance and stability, but the differences were minor\u2014certainly not worth paying 5-8x more for most users.\n\nThe 3% account survival difference translates to 1-2 additional lost accounts out of 50. If each account generates $100 monthly profit, that's $100-200 in lost revenue versus $300-600 in savings monthly with BitBrowser. **The math favors BitBrowser overwhelmingly.**\n\n# When Multilogin Makes Sense (Be Honest About Your Needs)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnyfvn5khuxf1.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=d09ca564afe838877c01f3efea2eaabe1840a84a\n\nDespite our strong recommendation for BitBrowser, Multilogin is the better choice for specific scenarios:\n\n# 1. Ultra-High-Stakes Operations\n\nIf individual account bans cost thousands of dollars (high-value merchant accounts, major brand advertising accounts, financial services), the marginal improvement in undetection rates justifies premium pricing. The extra 3-5% protection is worth it when failures are catastrophic.\n\n# 2. Enterprise Scale (500+ Profiles)\n\nAt massive scale, Multilogin's superior stability, unlimited team seats, and enterprise support become differentiators. The per-profile cost drops significantly on Business plans, narrowing the price gap while providing infrastructure BitBrowser struggles to match.\n\n# 3. Absolute Beginner Teams\n\nIf your entire team is non-technical and you need immediate productivity without training time, Multilogin's polished interface and 24/7 support justify the convenience premium. Time savings can outweigh monetary costs for some organizations.\n\n# 4. Mobile-First Operations\n\nIf you're primarily managing TikTok, Instagram, or other mobile apps requiring authentic mobile device emulation, Multilogin's Android/iOS profiles are more sophisticated than BitBrowser's desktop-focused approach.\n\n# 5. Zero-Tolerance for Downtime\n\nCompanies operating 24/7 with global teams benefit from Multilogin's around-the-clock multilingual support. If browser issues directly halt revenue, rapid expert support provides insurance value.\n\n**For everyone else\u2014and that's 85-90% of anti-detect browser users\u2014BitBrowser delivers better value.**\n\n# The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About\n\n# Multilogin Hidden Considerations:\n\n* **Proxy costs:** While built-in proxies are convenient, you'll quickly exceed included traffic. Additional proxy purchases at \u20ac3/GB add up fast\n* **Locked-in pricing:** Annual commitments required for best rates. Monthly pricing is significantly higher\n* **Feature limitations:** Pro plans restrict API calls and team members. Full features require Business plan at \u20ac159/month\n* **Learning curve:** Despite simple interface, effective fingerprint management still requires understanding concepts\n\n# BitBrowser Hidden Considerations:\n\n* **Proxy requirement:** You must source external proxies, adding $15-40 monthly depending on needs\n* **Interface complexity:** Steeper initial learning curve requires time investment\n* **Support hours:** Limited availability outside Asian time zones can delay problem resolution\n* **Localization issues:** Some interface elements and documentation remain better in Chinese\n\n# Net Analysis:\n\nEven accounting for all hidden costs, BitBrowser's total cost of ownership runs 50-70% less than Multilogin for equivalent profile counts and functionality.\n\n# Switching from Multilogin to BitBrowser: Is It Worth It?\n\nMany users ask: \"I'm already using Multilogin\u2014should I switch to BitBrowser to save money?\"\n\n# When Switching Makes Sense:\n\n* **Cost pressure:** If subscription costs strain your budget, potential annual savings of $300-800 significantly impact profitability\n* **Profile needs growing:** As you scale from 50 to 100+ profiles, Multilogin's costs escalate rapidly while BitBrowser remains affordable\n* **You've outgrown beginner stage:** If you're comfortable with anti-detect concepts and prefer feature-rich interfaces\n* **Automation focus:** If you need advanced automation without technical coding skills, BitBrowser's RPA tools excel\n\n# When Staying with Multilogin Makes Sense:\n\n* **Mission-critical operations:** If your business absolutely cannot tolerate even 2-3% more account restrictions\n* **Enterprise infrastructure:** Large teams with complex needs benefit from Multilogin's mature ecosystem\n* **Support dependency:** If you regularly need support and operate outside Asian hours\n* **Already have workflow established:** Migration time and potential disruption might not be worth savings\n\n# Migration Process:\n\nBoth browsers support profile export/import, though it's not seamless. Expect to spend 4-8 hours properly migrating 50 profiles, testing configurations, and training team members. For most users, this one-time investment pays for itself within 2-3 months of savings.\n\n# The Verdict: Value Over Brand Recognition\n\nAfter extensive comparison, the conclusion is clear: **For 85-90% of users, BitBrowser provides better value than Multilogin.**\n\n# BitBrowser Wins On:\n\n* **Price:** 50-80% lower cost for equivalent functionality\n* **Automation:** More powerful no-code tools and batch operations\n* **Features per dollar:** Dramatically better value proposition\n* **Permanent free plan:** 10 profiles forever vs. Multilogin's paid entry\n* **Customization:** Deeper control for advanced users\n\n# Multilogin Wins On:\n\n* **Detection avoidance:** Marginally better (3-5%) on strictest platforms\n* **Mobile emulation:** Superior iOS/Android profile support\n* **Support infrastructure:** 24/7 multilingual assistance\n* **Interface polish:** More beginner-friendly and streamlined\n* **Stability:** Slightly fewer crashes and technical issues\n\n# The Bottom Line:\n\nUnless you're operating enterprise-scale (500+ profiles), mission-critical operations where 99%+ uptime is mandatory, or require extensive hand-holding support, **you're overpaying dramatically for Multilogin.**\n\nBitBrowser delivers 85-95% of Multilogin's performance at 15-30% of the cost. That's exceptional value. The 5-15% performance gap simply doesn't justify paying 5-8 times more for most real-world applications.\n\n# Actionable Recommendation\n\n# Start Here:\n\n1. **Begin with BitBrowser's free plan** (10 profiles) \u2013 Test with your specific use case for 2-3 weeks\n2. **Compare against Multilogin's trial** (\u20ac1.99 for 3 days, 5 profiles) \u2013 Evaluate the difference yourself\n3. **Calculate your actual needs:** Profile count, automation requirements, team size\n4. **Run the numbers:** Total cost including proxies for 12 months\n5. **Make an informed decision** based on YOUR specific situation, not brand reputation\n\n# For Most Users:\n\n**Choose BitBrowser** and invest the $300-800 annual savings into:\n\n* Higher quality residential proxies\n* Additional team member\n* Marketing budget\n* Profile count expansion\n* Automation development\n\n# For Enterprise/High-Stakes Users:\n\n**Choose Multilogin** if budget isn't the primary constraint and you need:\n\n* Maximum detection avoidance\n* 24/7 support infrastructure\n* Team member scalability\n* Mobile-first emulation\n* Peace of mind from established brand\n\n\n\n# Final Thoughts: Smart Spending vs. Status Symbol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqqck0ifhuxf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1717b83d85ca7939138940626fe82d8e00e0f578\n\nMultilogin built its reputation when competitors didn't exist. It pioneered the anti-detect browser market and continues innovating. That legacy commands respect\u2014and premium pricing.\n\nBut in 2025, the market has matured. BitBrowser and other alternatives have closed the technology gap dramatically. You're no longer paying for cutting-edge innovation with Multilogin; you're paying for brand recognition, polish, and marginally better performance.\n\nFor startup founders, small agencies, and cost-conscious operators, that value equation doesn't compute. BitBrowser delivers professional-grade anti-detect capabilities at fraction of the cost, with features that often exceed Multilogin's offerings.\n\n**The smart money isn't on paying more\u2014it's on paying wisely.** And for the vast majority of multi-account managers, BitBrowser represents the wiser investment.\n\nTest both. Compare honestly. Calculate the actual value for YOUR specific needs. You'll likely reach the same conclusion: BitBrowser gives you 90% of the solution at 20% of the cost. That's not just good value\u2014that's exceptional value.\n\n\n\n# Quick Decision Matrix\n\n**Choose BitBrowser if:**\n\n* \u2705 Budget is a significant consideration\n* \u2705 You manage 10-500 profiles\n* \u2705 You want powerful automation without coding\n* \u2705 You're comfortable with technology (moderate learning curve)\n* \u2705 Support outside Asian hours isn't critical\n* \u2705 You operate primarily on desktop platforms\n\n**Choose Multilogin if:**\n\n* \u2705 Budget is not a limiting factor\n* \u2705 Individual account failures cost thousands\n* \u2705 You need 24/7 multilingual support\n* \u2705 Your team is completely non-technical\n* \u2705 Mobile-first platform management is your focus\n* \u2705 You operate at massive scale (500+ profiles)\n\nFor everyone else sitting on the fence: Start with BitBrowser's free plan. The only thing you'll regret is not discovering it sooner and the money you could have saved.",

      "selftext": "When evaluating a [commercial property for sale in Chandigarh](https://www.omaxe.com/commercial-property-in-new-chandigarh/omaxe-world-street), several critical factors demand your attention to ensure a smart and secure investment. Here\u2019s a focused guide for businesses and investors, based on offering from **Omaxe** in its *World Street* development.\n\n**1. Location & Connectivity**\n\nLocation remains the single most important factor.

A strong brand track record reduces risk and enhances resale value over time.\n\n**3. Project Design & Usage**\n\nCheck how the development caters to modern commercial needs. In *World Street*, you\u2019ll find double-height shop-cum-office units, open plazas, multiplex and entertainment zones all designed to attract diverse business types (retail, F&B, offices). Evaluate unit layouts, floor ceilings, visibility, parking and utility spaces as these directly impact tenant attractiveness.\n\n**4. Legal Compliance & Approval**\n\nEnsure the property has all necessary approvals RERA registration, zoning permissions and environmental clearances. Verify land title and whether usage is designated for retail, office or mixed purpose. Projects like World Street are RERA-registered and structured accordingly.\n\n**5. Infrastructure Quality & Amenities**\n\nHigh-quality construction, amenities such as 100% power backup, HVAC, robust security, lifts and parking substantially affect both operations and rental yields. *World Street* emphasizes such modern infrastructure as part of its design.\n\n**6. Market Demand & Tenant Mix**\n\nCommercial properties perform best when there is strong demand and a healthy mix of tenants. Check the nearby residential population, corporate presence and competing offerings. For example, World Street\u2019s mix of retail, leisure and business zones is tailored to create consistent foot traffic and diverse tenant profiles.\n\n**7. Financial Projections & Exit Potential**\n\nReview expected rental yields, escalation clauses, maintenance costs and future appreciation prospects. Location, developer brand and infrastructure all feed into exit potential properties in projects like *World Street* benefit from upscale positioning and may offer strong capital growth over time.\n\n**8. Flexibility & Lease Terms**\n\nProperties with flexible layouts (combining retail and office) allow broader tenant engagement. Shop-cum-office (SCO) units provide versatility. Verify whether lease terms are favourable, and whether the developer provides assistance for lease-up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**In Summary**\n\nTo purchase a reliable **commercial property for sale in Chandigarh**, ensure that you analyze location connectivity, developer credibility, project design & usage, legal compliance, infrastructure & amenities, market demand, financial viability, and flexibility. A carefully chosen unit in a thoughtfully planned development like *World Street* by Omaxe can offer promising rental returns, capital appreciation and long-term value. By doing your homework and selecting with care, you position yourself for a successful investment in Chandigarh\u2019s evolving commercial landscape.",

      "selftext": "[Management ](https://preview.redd.it/26hu8ijshuxf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f347b1775a62fe0c6a7e43b0215c1c9f3a679eab)\n\nIf you\u2019re aiming to start your management journey in 2026, this is the right time to prepare. With the business landscape evolving rapidly, a management degree today is about more than just learning theories\u2014it\u2019s about developing analytical thinking, leadership, and adaptability for a changing world.\n\nBefore you apply, here\u2019s a clear roadmap on what to expect, how to prepare, and what to look for in a B-school.\n\n# 1. Understand the Entrance Exams\n\nMost management institutes in India accept one or more national-level entrance tests. Each exam evaluates different skill sets, so understanding their patterns early can help you prepare smartly.\n\n* **CAT (Common Admission Test):** Conducted by the IIMs, it\u2019s one of the most competitive exams. Tests quantitative ability, logical reasoning, and verbal aptitude.\n* **XAT (XLRI Admission Test):** Includes an additional section on decision-making and essay writing.\n* **MAT / CMAT / NMAT:** Moderately challenging, accepted by several reputed colleges including IMS Ghaziabad.\n* **GMAT:** Preferred for international programs but also valid in select Indian B-schools.\n\nStart preparing around mid-2025 if you\u2019re targeting 2026 admissions. Regular practice and time management are key to handling these exams effectively.\n\n# 2. What You\u2019ll Study in a Management Program\n\nWhether you choose an MBA or a PGDM, the curriculum in most top management colleges focuses on core business foundations during the first year.  \nSubjects typically include:\n\n* Marketing and Brand Management\n* Financial Accounting and Analysis\n* Human Resource Management\n* Operations and Supply Chain\n* Business Analytics and Economics\n* Strategic Management\n\nThe second year usually allows you to specialize in areas such as Marketing, Finance, HR, Data Analytics, or Entrepreneurship.  \nAt institutions like **IMS Ghaziabad**, students also work on live projects and internships, gaining exposure to real business challenges and corporate environments.\n\n# 3. Develop the Right Skill Set\n\nThe best management professionals combine analytical, technical, and interpersonal skills. Before joining any program, start building:\n\n* Critical thinking and problem-solving ability\n* Data interpretation and basic Excel or Power BI knowledge\n* Communication and presentation skills\n* Awareness of current business and economic trends\n\nShort internships, case study competitions, and online courses can help you stand out during interviews and group discussions.\n\n# 4. Choosing the Right B-School\n\nSelecting the right management college is crucial. Instead of relying solely on rankings, consider these factors:\n\n* Accreditation (AICTE, NBA, NAAC, or AIU)\n* Faculty expertise and teaching approach\n* Placement opportunities and corporate linkages\n* Alumni network and industry exposure\n\nColleges like IMS Ghaziabad, IMS Ghaziabad, NMIMS, Christ University, and TAPMI are known for combining academic learning with practical industry engagement\u2014an essential quality for modern management education.\n\n# 5. Start with Clarity\n\nA management degree is more than a qualification; it\u2019s a launchpad for leadership. Focus on conceptual understanding, stay consistent with your preparation, and choose a college that aligns with your long-term goals.\n\nIf you approach it strategically, 2026 can be the year you take the first confident step toward building a successful management career.",

      "selftext": " $CBDL News: CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC: CBDL) Launches Tremendous Energy & Weight-Loss Diet Hemp-Free Gummies\nTuesday, 28 October 2025 07:00 AM\n\nTopic: Company Update\n\nGlobal functional gummy supplements market projected to surpass $50 billion by 2030 - CBDL expands into two of the fastest-growing segments in wellness and performance nutrition.\n\nSCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA / ACCESS Newswire / October 28, 2025 / CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC:CBDL), an emerging leader in wellness innovation and nutraceutical advancement, proudly announces the official launch of its new Energy Boost and Diet & Weight-Loss Hemp-Free Gummies, both formulated with 100 mg vegan, plant-based ingredients. These new releases position CBDL at the intersection of two of the most explosive consumer categories in the global supplement market: energy enhancement and weight management.\n\nAn Expanding Billion-Dollar Market Opportunity\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights and Grand View Research, the global gummy supplements market is projected to skyrocket from $23.93 billion in 2023 to over $52 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 11.8-13%. Within that, functional wellness gummies - focused on energy, fitness, and weight control - represent one of the fastest-growing categories in nutraceuticals.\n\nWith these launches, CBDL now competes directly in a high-margin, mainstream market appealing to millions of consumers who prefer convenient, hemp-free, and vegan-friendly supplements.\n\nProduct Overview\n\nEnergy Boost Gummies - 100 mg\nCrafted for active lifestyles and peak performance, these vegan gummies feature a green-tea extract + caffeine + BCAA + L-Arginine blend, offering a clean energy lift with a refreshing energy-drink flavor profile. Designed for athletes, professionals, and everyday consumers needing focus, stamina, and clarity.\n\nDiet & Weight-Loss Gummies - 100 mg\nThis proprietary hemp-free formula combines Maca Root Powder, Caffeine, Yohimbe Extract, Guarana, and Bitter Orange Extract to help support metabolism, fat burning, and appetite control naturally. Entirely vegan, non-GMO, and formulated with plant-based ingredients for health-conscious consumers seeking results without compromise.\n\nPositioned for Scale - A Strategic Expansion Beyond CBD\n\nBy entering the functional wellness market, CBDL is:\n\nDiversifying revenue beyond hemp and CBD-exclusive verticals, appealing to mainstream retailers and broader audiences.\n\nExpanding shelf potential in fitness, nutrition, and pharmacy channels, both online and in brick-and-mortar distribution.\n\nCapitalizing on sustained consumer demand for clean-label, vegan, and hemp-free products across multiple demographics.\n\nLeveraging its existing e-commerce and retail partnerships to roll out these SKUs at scale, with strong early interest from wellness distributors and private-label opportunities.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\"This is a defining moment for our company,\" said Lisa Nelson, President & CEO of CBD Life Sciences Inc.\n\"We've built our brand on trust and results. With these hemp-free, high-performance gummies, we're no longer just a CBD company - we're a full-scale wellness brand entering billion-dollar markets that reward innovation and quality. Investors should understand how significant this is - these launches can open new sales channels, increase margins, and attract large-scale distribution opportunities nationwide.\"\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nCBDL's new gummies represent more than a product drop - they signal the company's transformation into a next-generation wellness platform. As consumer trends shift toward performance nutrition, daily energy, and weight-management support, CBDL's research-backed formulations position it for sustained growth, profitability, and heightened investor visibility within the OTC small-cap market.\n\n\n\nAbout CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC: CBDL)\n\nCBD Life Sciences Inc. is a publicly traded health-and-wellness company focused on developing innovative cannabinoid and plant-based nutraceuticals. Through its flagship brand, The CBD Vault, the company offers premium wellness products including topicals, tinctures, edibles, beverages, and functional supplements.

      "selftext": "\n\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n#### SEC Filing Analysis: SHERWIN WILLIAMS CO (SHW)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: High\n- **Key Takeaway**: Sherwin-Williams filed a Form 8-K to announce its third-quarter 2025 financial results, reporting solid growth in sales and earnings per share, and narrowing its full-year guidance.\n- **Market Impact**: Earnings reports are highly material events that typically lead to increased trading volume and potential price volatility as investors digest the new information and updated outlook.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | SHERWIN WILLIAMS CO |\n| Ticker Symbol | SHW |\n| CIK | 0000089800 |\n| Industry | Retail-Building Materials, Hardware, Garden Supply |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Not Applicable |\n| CIK | Not Applicable |\n| Title/Position | Not Applicable |\n| Relationship | Not Applicable |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n*This Form 8-K is for reporting corporate events (earnings release) and does not contain insider transaction data.*\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Form Type | 8-K |\n| Transaction Date | Not Applicable |\n| Transaction Code | Not Applicable |\n| Security Type | Not Applicable |\n| Shares Involved | Not Applicable |\n| Price Per Share | Not Applicable |\n| Total Value | Not Applicable |\n| Shares Owned After | Not Applicable |\n| Ownership Type | Not Applicable |\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\n#### Q3 2025 Performance Highlights\n\n| Metric | Value | Year-over-Year Change |\n|--------|-------|-----------------------|\n| Consolidated Net Sales | $6.36 Billion | +3.2% |\n| Diluted Net Income per Share | $3.35 | +5.3% |\n| Adjusted Diluted EPS | $3.59 | +6.5% |\n| Net Income | $833.1 Million | +3.3% |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | $1.36 Billion | +6.0% |\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Market Cap Context**: As a large-cap company with an $83.28 billion market capitalization, Sherwin-Williams' ability to generate consistent growth, even in a soft market, is a key indicator of its market leadership and operational efficiency.\n- **Shareholder Returns**: The company returned $864 million to shareholders in Q3 through dividends and share repurchases. Over the first nine months of 2025, it repurchased 4.5 million shares, representing approximately 1.8% of total shares outstanding, providing support for EPS.\n- **Guidance Update**: The narrowing of the full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to $11.25 - $11.45 provides investors with increased certainty for the year's financial outcome. The midpoint of the new guidance ($11.35) is slightly above the prior year's $11.33, suggesting modest bottom-line growth for the full year.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Neutral to Positive\n- **Reasoning**: The company reported solid growth in both revenue and earnings, demonstrating resilience. While the CEO's comments on a \"softer for longer\" demand environment could temper enthusiasm, the positive results and shareholder returns are likely to be well-received by the market.\n\n#### Volume & Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: High. Earnings releases are significant catalysts for trading activity.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Bullish. The report highlights strength in key professional segments (Paint Stores Group) and effective cost management, which are positive signals for investors.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- Consistent top-line and bottom-line growth.\n- Strong performance in the core Paint Stores Group, with sales growth in all professional end markets.\n- Significant capital return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n- Margin expansion and effective cost controls.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- CEO's commentary points to a sustained soft demand environment.\n- The Consumer Brands Group continues to face challenges with a 2.6% decrease in net sales.\n- Performance Coatings Group segment profit decreased by 7.5% due to unfavorable sales mix.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Operational Strength**: Sherwin-Williams is successfully navigating a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, leveraging its strong position with professional contractors.\n2. **Shareholder Friendly**: The company continues to prioritize returning cash to shareholders, with $2.13 billion returned in the first nine months of the year.\n3. **Segment Divergence**: While the professional-focused Paint Stores Group is performing well, the consumer-facing segment is showing weakness, reflecting broader economic trends.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\n#### Transaction Notes\n\n- **Event**: This Form 8-K, under Item 2.02, serves to furnish the company's Q3 2025 earnings press release to the public.\n- **Timing**: The filing was made on October 28, 2025, reporting results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.\n- **Market Environment**: The report was issued amid concerns about a softer demand environment, making the company's positive results particularly noteworthy.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

      "selftext": "Sent to the team as the next, and necessary steps........                                                             \nBlockDAG Tokenomics Implementation Brief: Solution 4 & Community Feedback (Updated with Post-Adjustment Summary)\n\nPrepared By: Reid Davis (Community Manager - Alaska) Date: October 28, 2025 To: Nic (BlockDAG Leadership) Purpose: This document organizes applicable community feedback from recent chats on implementing Solution 4 (75% flat reduction of bonus tokens, reducing them to 25% retention and aligning total presale to 50Bn while preserving base tokens and other allocations). I've updated the recap with the latest post-adjustment summary from the AMA, showing the finalized breakdown after the cut.\n\n1. Updated Recap of Solution 4 (From AMA Screenshot & Post-Adjustment Summary)\n\n\u2022\tCore Mechanism: Reduce bonus tokens by 75% (retaining 25%) to address the presale oversell, capping total presale at 50Bn and have it implemented by October 30, 2025 17:00hrs Dubai (GMT+4)\n\n\u2022\tKey Features:\n\n\u25e6\tSimple and targeted: Only affects bonuses (troublemakers); base tokens untouched.\n\n\u25e6\tFairness restoration: Early investors (higher base-to-bonus ratio) less impacted; later \"Double Up\" investors more affected.\n\n\u25e6\tNo devaluation of other allocations: Mining (75Bn), Community & Ecosystem (19Bn), Liquidity (4.5Bn), Team (1.5Bn) remain intact.\n\n\u25e6\tTotal Supply: Caps at 150Bn (whitepaper allocation), with pre-sale breakdown post-adjustment as follows:\n\n\u2022\tBase BDAGs Already Sold: 16Bn\n\n\u2022\tAllocation for Remaining Presale: 2Bn\n\n\u2022\tAllocation for X1: 2Bn\n\n\u2022\tAllocation for TAP Miner: 2Bn\n\n\u2022\tBonus BDAG (reduced to 25%): 28Bn\n\n\u2022\tTOTAL Presale: 50Bn\n\n\u2022\tPost-Adjustment Effective Price Calculation:\n\n\u25e6\tCurrent base price: ~$0.032 (tokens per $1: ~31.25 base).\n\n\u25e6\tCurrent effective price with bonuses: $0.0015 (tokens per $1: ~666.67 total, implying ~635.42 bonus per $1).\n\n\u25e6\tAfter 75% bonus cut (25% retained): Bonus per $1 drops to ~158.85; total tokens per $1: ~190.1.\n\n\u25e6\tNew effective price: ~$0.00526 per token (a ~251% value increase from $0.0015, rewarding holders by reducing dilution without changing base costs).\n\n\u2022\tCommunity Alignment: Broad support for this as the \"best option\" due to its equity and ease\u2014e.g., \"just f'ing fix it!\" (Rob Nicholson).\n\n2. Organized Community Feedback on Solution 4 Implementation\n\nI've categorized feedback into actionable areas: Fairness & Calculation, Simplicity & Execution, No More Bonuses, and General Concerns. Only included input that aligns with or enhances Solution 4 (e.g., flat/proportional reductions within bonuses). Quotes are direct for context; prioritized by frequency.\n\n\u2022\tFairness & Calculation Details:\n\n\u25e6\tEnsure the 75% reduction is applied proportionately across all bonus holders to maintain equity (Jim Ninnemann: \"Reduce 75% proportionately for everyone\"). Avoid tiers or evaluations that complicate things\u2014focus on a flat cut based on existing base vs. bonus ratios, which naturally favors early investors with more base tokens (Reid's response to Guillaume Dayer: \"It'll be a flat reduction... fairness happens organically due to more base vs bonus\").\n\n\u25e6\tBase reductions on amount spent/invested, not just timing, to account for risk exposure (Steven Elrod: \"Just base it on how much the person spent. Nothing else\"). However, factor in purchase timing for inherent fairness\u2014early buyers at lower prices already compensated.\n\n\u25e6\tVerify calculations with examples: Show how a late investor with high bonuses (e.g., 61MM BDAG at $0.0015) drops to ~15MM post-cut, vs. early investor retention (Brichard Michaels/Steven Elrod comparisons).\n\n\u2022\tSimplicity & Execution Details:\n\n\u25e6\tKeep it easy and fast\u2014no complex tiers, as they risk errors and delays (Brichard Michaels: \"As soon as you try to start doing a tiered evaluation... you'll end up creating more problems. Their ability to deploy that [is concerning] ... 75% cut is the only option that meets those criteria\").\n\n\u25e6\tImplement across the board for all bonuses to ensure fairness and speed (Brichard Michaels: \"The best way to eat this shit sandwich is everyone taking an equal bite\").\n\n\u25e6\tTimeline: Immediate halt to bonuses during implementation; share dashboard previews/simulations for holders to verify reductions before finalization.\n\n\u2022\tNo More Bonuses Post-Implementation:\n\n\u25e6\tEnforce a permanent ban on new bonuses until presale ends to prevent recurrence (Jim Ninnemann: \"AND NO more bonuses!\"; Neil Stratton: \"Antony said back in March 'No more bonuses.' Gurhan Kiziloz didn\u2019t honor Antony\u2019s directive and continued to offer bonuses despite the CEO\u2019s directive/community promise...\").\n\n\u2022\tGeneral Concerns & Mitigations:\n\n\u25e6\tAcknowledge the \"headache\" and emotional impact\u2014reassure it's a \"Halloween miracle\" for project health (Jeff MacPeek/Kathryn Winfrey: \"I have a headache... amazing to listen to changes implemented for the good\").\n\n\u25e6\tTie to broader goals: This fixes dilution from \"bonus frenzy\" without hurting base investors (Ji My: \"Bonus frenzy was very unfair and sketchy... greatly diluted the BDAG value\").\n\n3. Revised Proposed Plan for Selling the Remaining 2Bn Base Tokens\n\nTo support existing investors (who've faced dilution from oversold presale at $0.0015 vs. base $0.032), we need a structured sales plan that rebuilds value through legitimate growth. This starts from the post-adjustment effective price (~$0.005) and escalates gradually to the white paper\u2019s $0.05 listing goal, avoiding abrupt jumps. This counters pre-sale damage by shifting from scammer tactics to marketing based on tech (DAG-blockchain hybrid for 10,000+ TPS), development (e.g., mainnet progress, EIP-4337), dApps (via Buildathon), and partnerships (Alpine F1, Seattle Orcas, etc.).\n\n\u2022\tPhased Sales Structure (3-6 Months to Mainnet, Escalating from $0.005 Effective):\n\n\u25e6\tPhase 1: Stabilization & Loyalty (First 500MM Tokens, 1-2 Weeks): Sell at $0.006-$0.008 (20-60% above post-adjust $0.005). Prioritize existing holders with a 48-hour exclusive window; limit per wallet (e.g., 10x current holdings) to reward early risk. Tie to 3-month vesting for stability.\n\n\u25e6\tPhase 2: Utility Build-Out (Next 1Bn Tokens, 1-2 Months): Escalate to $0.085-$0.02 (100-300% above start). Bundle with dApp access or partnership perks (e.g., Alpine F1 simulators for buyers >$1K). Require 30% staking for ecosystem yields (e.g., governance in Buildathon dApps). Market via tech webinars (e.g., DAG speed vs. blockchain bottlenecks).\n\n\u25e6\tPhase 3: Momentum to Listing (Final 500MM Tokens, 1-2 Months): Ramp to $0.025-$0.045 (500-800% above start, approaching $0.05). Limited daily batches (e.g., 50MM/day) for scarcity FOMO. Highlight milestones (e.g., Inter Milan NFT integrations, Seattle Orcas events)\u2014position as \"value-driven growth.\"\n\n\u2022\tValue-Building Marketing Shift:\n\n\u25e6\tTech-Centric Campaigns: Highlight whitepaper innovations (e.g., PHANTOM/GHOSTDAG for parallel processing) via webinars/AMAs. Partner with devs for dApp showcases\u2014e.g., DeFi Speedway in Buildathon.\n\n\u25e6\tPartnership Leverage: Use Alpine F1 (races in Mexico/Sao Paulo) and Seattle Orcas for co-branded content\u2014e.g., \"Race to $0.05\" streams tying DAG speed to F1 thrills.\n\n\u25e6\tRisk Mitigation: Cap sales to avoid dilution; audit funds pre/post (see below). Aim for $100M raise from 2Bn at avg. $0.02 = ~$40M.\n\nThis plan restores credibility, counters presale damage, and positions BDAG for $0.05+ listing by emphasizing real utility over hype.\n\n4. Next Major Concern: Comprehensive Third-Party Audit\n\nOnce Solution 4 is implemented, the community strongly emphasizes the need for a complete and full audit of investor funds by a reputable third-party firm to restore confidence. This should verify the presale's integrity and prevent future issues, given the lack of a CFO. Key details for coverage:\n\n\u2022\tScope of the Audit:\n\n\u25e6\tTokens Sold: Full accounting of all base and bonus tokens issued (pre- and post-Solution 4), including breakdowns by batch, promo (e.g., PWA, Double Up), and source (e.g., X1/TAP miners).\n\n\u25e6\tMonies Raised: Total funds collected (~$430M+), with breakdowns by payment method (e.g., ETH, USDT), investor geography, and presale phase. Verify against wallet addresses for discrepancies.\n\n\u25e6\tMonies Spent: Itemized expenditures (e.g., marketing via WPRO, development, partnerships like Alpine F1/Inter Milan, operations). Include timelines and receipts to ensure no unauthorized outflows.\n\n\u25e6\tOther Elements: Wallet holdings (who controls what?); unallocated tokens; any refunds/compensations; compliance with whitepaper allocations (e.g., 50Bn presale cap pre-oversell).\n\n\u2022\tAuditor Selection: Recommend a reputable firm like Certik (already used for tech audits\u2014extend to finances), PeckShield, Halborn, or SlowMist for impartiality and expertise in crypto funds.\n\n\u2022\tTimeline & Transparency: Conduct immediately post-Solution 4 rollout; share high-level results publicly (e.g., dashboard summary) within 30 days to address skepticism (Carlos Barreira: \"First they must guarantee/verify/audit... otherwise we'll have a 'limp' solution\").\n\n\u2022\tRationale: This ensures \"100% accountability\" (Johnny Moore: \"They paid no attention to how much they had and how much they spent\"), aligns with AMA directives, and prevents \"shocker\" revelations.\n\n               ",

      "title": "**V. F. Corporation** ($VFC): VF Corp. to Sell Dickies Brand for $600 Million in Strategic Move",
      "selftext": "\n\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n#### SEC Filing Analysis: V. F. Corporation (VFC)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: High\n- **Key Takeaway**: V. F. Corporation announced a definitive agreement to sell its Dickies\u00ae brand business for $600 million, a material transaction representing 9.42% of the company's market capitalization. Proceeds are earmarked for debt reduction.\n- **Market Impact**: This strategic divestiture is likely to be viewed positively by the market as a significant step in the company's turnaround plan to streamline its portfolio and strengthen its financial position.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | V. F. Corporation |\n| Ticker Symbol | VFC |\n| CIK | 0000103379 |\n| Industry | Men's & Boys' Furnishings, Work Clothing, and Allied Garments |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Not Applicable (Corporate Filing) |\n| CIK | null |\n| Title/Position | null |\n| Relationship | null |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Form Type | 8-K |\n| Transaction Date | 2025-09-15 |\n| Transaction Code | Not Applicable |\n| Security Type | Brand Business Unit (Dickies\u00ae) |\n| Shares Involved | Not Applicable |\n| Price Per Share | Not Applicable |\n| Total Value | $600,000,000 |\n| Shares Owned After | Not Applicable |\n| Ownership Type | Not Applicable |\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\n#### Transaction Materiality\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Transaction Value | $600,000,000 |\n| % of Market Cap | 9.42% |\n| Shares Transacted | Not Applicable |\n| % of Shares Outstanding | Not Applicable |\n| Post-Transaction Ownership | Not Applicable |\n| Materiality Assessment | Highly Significant |\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Market Cap Context**: For a company with a $6.37 billion market cap, a single asset sale of $600 million is a substantial strategic move. It fundamentally alters the company's asset base and financial structure.\n- **Balance Sheet Impact**: The company explicitly stated that the proceeds will be used to pay down debt. As of the filing, net debt was down $1.5B year-over-year, and this transaction will further de-lever the balance sheet, reducing interest expenses and financial risk.\n- **Strategic Realignment**: The filing notes that the transaction will be accretive to VF's growth rate on a pro-forma basis. This indicates that Dickies was likely a lower-growth or lower-margin asset, and its removal is intended to improve the overall financial profile of the remaining portfolio, which includes The North Face\u00ae and Timberland\u00ae.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Positive\n- **Reasoning**: The market generally rewards decisive strategic actions that simplify a company's story, reduce debt, and improve growth metrics. The sale price of $600M provides a clear valuation for the brand and unlocks significant capital.\n\n#### Volume & Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: Increased trading volume is expected as investors digest the strategic shift and its implications for future earnings and growth.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Bullish. This action demonstrates management's commitment to its stated turnaround plan and its willingness to make tough decisions to create shareholder value.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- **Active Portfolio Management**: The sale of Dickies, following the recent divestiture of Supreme, shows management is actively pruning its portfolio.\n- **Debt Reduction**: Using the $600M proceeds to pay down debt is a clear positive for financial stability.\n- **Focus on Core Brands**: The divestiture allows management to concentrate capital and attention on its higher-performing brands.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- **Loss of Diversification**: Selling a major brand reduces revenue stream diversification.\n- **Future Growth Pressure**: The remaining brands must now generate sufficient growth to offset the revenue lost from the divested unit.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Highly Material Divestiture**: The $600M sale of Dickies represents 9.42% of VFC's market cap, making it a highly significant corporate action.\n2. **Turnaround Plan in Action**: This is a concrete step in management's plan to simplify the business and strengthen the balance sheet.\n3. **Improved Financial Profile**: The transaction is expected to reduce debt and be accretive to the company's overall growth rate.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\n#### Transaction Notes\n\n- **Timing**: The definitive agreement was signed on September 15, 2025, with the transaction expected to close during Q3 of Fiscal 2026.\n- **Other Events**: This news was released alongside Q2 Fiscal 2026 earnings and a quarterly dividend announcement of $0.09 per share.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

Members of the council of elders who wish to remove the too-heroic Uzumaki Naruto appear to be seeking to oust Ikkyu along with Naruto. Among them are quite a few individuals who are under **Kara**'s control through **Outers**. The reason why **Kara** is able to not-so-secretly move squads inside the Land of Fire is due to the actions of politicians and merchants opposed to the Ikkyu-Naruto administration.\"  \n\u2014 [Shinobi Hiden Column 5: Daimyo and Shinobi](https://i.imgur.com/lDfEE5h.jpeg), *Boruto NNG* Vol. 10, p. 50\n\n---\n\nKobu would also likely be motivated by his own goal of ousting Shikamaru and Ikkyu from power for his own political gain. Of particular note, that Hiden Column also mentioned that Sunagakure's involvement in Orochimaru's Operation: Demolish Konoha, following the disarmament of the Land of Wind, is still a fresh memory that has sown distrust and contributed to the daimyo wanting to cease their reliance on shinobi.\n\nObviously, a major factor in Kobu's investigation is the unsanctioned mission Shikamaru carried out in the Land of Wind on the behalf of Sunagakure, whose administration he shares a direct familial bond with through marriage.\n\nAt the same time, Ino's relationship with Shikamaru has started to fray, and with Inojin being drawn into Boruto's orbit so soon after being near-fatally wounded, she will likely not stand with him if he falls under investigation. Sai, too, has been shown quietly observing Shikamaru, Amado, and the interrogations Kobu is conducting.\n\nWhat happens when it is revealed that Boruto and Koji have their hideout in one of Orochimaru's old lairs beneath the Land of Wind? What happens when Kobu witnesses firsthand Bug's attack and Konoha's response?\n\n---\n\nPossible ramifications if this is true:\n\n1. Kobu uncovers the identity and whereabouts of Boruto and Kashin Koji and passes that information along to Code. Code is able to find and attack them, with Kashin Koji in particular being vulnerable, especially if Boruto is otherwise occupied or Momoshiki has assumed control of his body.\n\n2. Kobu successfully constructs a narrative that brands Shikamaru a traitor, potentially the mastermind of a conspiracy to overthrow the daimyo. Shikamaru is removed from power and the daimyo start moving towards demilitarizing and decoupling from the ninja villages, signaling the beginning of the end for the era of Shinobi.\n\n3. The potential return of other characters to the plot, including: Kakashi, as Shikamaru's successor, brought out of retirement and tasked with overseeing the elimination of the renegade Boruto and his collaborators to clear Konoha of suspicion; Lord Tento, heir apparent to the Land of Fire and childhood friend of Kawaki* who greatly respects shinobi and wishes to maintain ties with Konoha. Shinki and Araya, Sunagakure shinobi at the center of the mission that's being investigated, who bear a grudge against the Divine Tree beings.\n\n4. Interpersonal drama and political fallout between many of the characters, possibly causing a major shakeup in leadership, imprisonments, defection, etc. This may also see the likes of Sumire, Katasuke, Amado, Kawaki, and Delta take on a new role as they aren't strictly shinobi.\n\n5. Konohagakure and Orochimaru's abandoned base are no longer safe locations, prompting characters to go on the run or find new hideouts, changing up the settings being featured.\n\n6. Eida and Koji both potentially being removed as pieces from the game board in the aftermath of the arc, eliminating the advantages their Clairvoyance and Prescience provide.",

      "title": "I am torn between filing for divorce and becoming better after my fault",
      "selftext": "tl;dr I am thinking about divorcing my wife after she told me she doesn't love me anymore after our bumpy road. Yesterday I heard her talking with her mother on the phone when she thought I was asleep and she was talking about plans that she has in two or three years- they didn't include me anymore, but a potential for someone else in my stead.\n\n  \nHello everyone! Never thought I would visit this sub, never even imagined I would be in this situation I am currently in. With that being said I have to vent and ask about your opinion on what to do next, since I am incredibly conflicted. The conflict is, because theoretically in my mind I am at fault here.\n\n**Introduction:** I have met my wife 10 years ago, we had the same hobbies, we had the same vision. We were a pair instantly. Two years later we married and moved in together. After one year we had our only daughter. Maybe cliche, but our child has been the first main issue on the road. It turned out that we had two different views, even when we discussed it beforehand. In that time she went for pregnancy and maternal leave and I was the one working long hours, sometimes leaving at 6am and coming back at 7pm due to traffic and work overload. To put it simply, after the birth, the loneliness she felt while being led her to postpartum depression. At that time I tried to do as much as I could while providing for us both.   \nThe first 3 years of our child were a nightmare. We were constantly fighting about anything and everything. I tried to calm things down as much as I could, but in moments, when she went overboard and started making some hurtful comments about me being a bad husband and father, I pushed back with the same force. This back and forth created a rift between us.   \nHowever the worst was yet to come. After the three years passed, we became aggressive towards another. I would stop listening to her aggressive runts and just smile with malice at her. One day that made her so furious that she started hitting me. I know, major red flag, should've intervened there and then. Today I can tell that we needed therapy, but what is gone is gone. The physical interactions didn't stop. Her rage outbursts became violent, while I was just trying to stop her from hitting me. This is where my greatest mistake and regret comes in. One day after she started the usual, she punched me really hard and since I was next to a well I hit my head really hard. Dazed from the impact I hit her back for the first and last time ever. She stopped in her tracks surprised by what had just happened. We said nothing the whole evening. Then we cried together the whole night together chanting \"I'm sorrys\" for what we had been doing the whole time. I am not proud of it happening, never will be and never should be. The circumstances should have never occured.  \nWe then went out of our ways to try and resolve conflicts more peacefully, we worked hard to make our relationship even bearable, with great success tbh. Everything started to become better, we started trusting each other again, I got a better paid job, closer to home so I had more time with her and our daughter.   \n  \nFast forward to two years ago, we have made a major change to our hobbies. I started teaching her to become better in a game we played and it turned out that with my guidance, she became one of the high level players, even better than I was. She found a team of dudes and her that she was playing with. They didn't particularly like me, except for one who befriended me, because I was too slow for their needs. Our common passion with time became me watching her spend time with her team and not play myself. Why do I mention it? Because she started to envision to do more with her team. Her team was mostly dudes from one country, while she was the only outsider that was taken in because of her skill.   \nAll the while she started to distance herself a bit and belittle me in the things I have done wrong. Didn't pay in time? Big argument. Didn't do the dishes? Was called incredibly lazy. Name calling became a thing and we started to be annoyed by each other again. Add to that stress I felt at work and her constant nagging with trying to find any \"needle\" she could stick in my back, I became very reactive to her constant issues.  \n\nHalf a year ago she became the nicest person ever, trying to change for the better. She started supporting me, helping me chill out if possible, and lift any burden off of me. I have seen the change in her.  \nBut I messed up there a lot. I was distrustful of her attitude and didn't change my \"barking\" at her when she brought up things to do, as I thought she wanted to treat me bad again as it was previously. \n\nShe also started to visit her team abroad without me, sometimes for a few days. They were doing events together, but I suspected there is something more, which I will talk about later.\n\nTwo months ago I decided to give it a try to change, become more patient and become a better man. I think that it was too late. Just after my road to become better began, we had an argument that she couldn't forgive me what I have done in the past. The current me reminds her of what I did that night when I hit her back and she doesn't see any improvement on my part. I told her that I will change, already started, but she didn't believe me. Since then we had a cold war where we wouldn't talk about serious relationship issues, only about day to day life. If you were in a room with us the air would be heavy.\n\n**Main topic:**  \nWell, it all changed last week. I started a talk about how I try actively to be better, and that I want to be with my little loving \\[insert pet name I had for her\\]. The response broke my heart, as she said, that that \"loving \\[pet name\\]\" doesn't exist anymore. I asked her what she meant and she said: Exactly what you heard. I then asked directly if she loves me, but she said she doesn't know anymore. She then talked for an hour about all of my past mistakes, completely ignoring her own, especially bringing up the part that she doesn't trust me ever since I hit her back. I tried to defend myself in a way that would not sound accusatory towards her. But it didn't matter too much. She told me that she will see what will change within the next year, who I will become and then she will make the decision whether to stay with me or not. \n\nAfter that I was visibly shaken, but I understand now that she put effort then and didn't see any from my side. It was justified, by her to want me to change. Bringing up the past wasn't though.\n\nWith that being said I could side with her in that argument. I was thinking for the rest of the week about it and started to make small and big changes to how I treated her.\n\nHowever, I soon found out that it is not the only factor. Yesterday when she thought I was asleep I woke up to get some water to drink. I realized she was talking to someone on the phone closed in one room, turned out to be her mother.   \nI heard a bit of her talking about her problems with me, and honestly I wouldn't mind it, if it ended on that topic, since I understand how she feels.   \nI kept listening and then she started to talk about the plans she has for the next two or three years. She said that she sees that I want to change, but it doesn't seem to be enough for her. She mentioned that she will probably give it another year to see where it goes, but that she feels nothing anymore. Her mom asked her what then and the answer was something like this:   \n\"If I want to stay with him for the sake of our child, I will, but I think we will only be partners in raising a child, not lovers anymore, if I see nothing on his side. If this doesn't work... I will move out back to you and we will sell our house, pay back our mortgage and what is left I will keep. I will take HER(our daughter) from him and will turn her against him, so in the divorce she won't be torn between us and prefer only me. I also have an alternative. You know the guy I was talking about you from my team? He is the sweetest and calmest person ever. The time I spend with him, I am able to forget all my troubles. If \\[my name\\] forces me, I will probably use the money from the house and with his share I will buy a house in that country and move there with my daughter.\"  \nShe added then: \"But mom, I don't want this, I don't want any of this to happen. I want it to work out, I want it to be as it was when I met him. But I will never be out of options again. I need to feel safe again.\"  \nThis shattered my heart and I have been desperate to find the road for me since. \n\n  \nSo here am I venting to strangers about it, since I have noone else today and can't hold it back until I meed a friend. Two points on the way:  \n1. I am convinced she didn't cheat on me yet, at least not sexually, as I have information from the one of the group that was kinda an outsider, that no intimacy between her and the guy she mentioned to her mother happened. That dude was hitting on her, but she always rejected his efforts in public, though they were blurred lines between them for a while.   \n2. I feel like it is my fault that this situation happened. I was not the person I should have been for her.   \n  \nWith all being said, I want to ask you what to do about it. On one hand I feel tired by my thoughts, since I have been battling them for a long time. I want this all to end so bad.   \nBut I want my daughter to be with me. My wife once told me that if she ever wanted to leave, she will prepare the worst presentation of mine to the court so that I will be branded as an aggressive, controling deadbeat, and will even get a restraining order against me. She said she will present herself as the fearful being hurt by a big bad man. It was years ago, but I believe that she would do it if she decided to go that route. Cut me off entirely.   \nThat's why divorcing her, even if I was to suddenly announce it before she had time to prepare, would still be a lost cause for me, if I want to see my daughter ever again. I thought about it and the only thing that would be able to save me in that case would prove her infidelity. Hiring a private investigator that would find her in situations with only that guy who gives his professional opinion about it is what I thought of.  \n I had also ideas about going to a relationship psychologist to talk about my troubles and saying all the hurt she has done to me as a precaution, so that a specialist's opinion would be taken into account in the possible divorce process.  \nEven with evidence of betrayal and the opinion, this would be a close case, as my country has blatant preference towards women keeping children and men going on child support, even when fault in the divorce would be on the woman's side, as it can be blamed on trauma she has from the relationship with the husband. Still 50/50 custody would be more achievable in that case.  \nIf I wait, and have nothing prepared for the battle, I will lose everything, but I think I would be playing dirty if I did what I want to do if I go for the divorce.\n\nOn the other hand.. If I move now or in the next future, I will never be able to look myself in the face again, since I didn't try to make the relationship better and just jumped out of the boat without trying. Especially, since I think it is possible to make up, with great effort on my side. \n\nMaybe you will give me some thoughts that I might have missed. I really want our relationship to work again, since I didn't stop loving her, but I am afraid it is too far gone and it is all my fault. \n\n",

      "selftext": "The hospitality industry thrives on comfort, aesthetics, and ambiance \u2014 three elements that are significantly influenced by furniture design. Among the various pieces that define a hotel's elegance, **hotel chairs** stand out as silent ambassadors of luxury, comfort, and design philosophy. Choosing the right chairs can transform a space from ordinary to extraordinary, leaving guests with lasting impressions.\n\nWhen it comes to sourcing high-quality hotel chairs in India, one name consistently stands above the rest \u2014 **Best of Exports**, the **No.1 hotel and restaurant chairs manufacturer in India**. With decades of experience, exceptional craftsmanship, and an unwavering commitment to quality, Best of Exports has become the preferred choice for hotels, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and resorts across the country and beyond.\n\n# Understanding the Importance of Hotel Chairs\n\nBefore diving into what makes Best of Exports the leader in this industry, it\u2019s essential to understand the role hotel chairs play in hospitality design.\n\nHotel chairs are not merely functional items; they are central to the **guest experience**.

      "title": "Kefine Delci AE: When spectacularity becomes art!",
      "selftext": "**Hello community!**\n\nHere I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn\u2019t hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present **my sources:**\n\n\\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  \n\\-FiiO KA13 while working.  \n\\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  \n\\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  \n\\-FiiO KA11.  \n\\-FiiO JA11.  \n\\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  \n\\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  \n\\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  \n\\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**\n\n*-Pros*  \n\\>The most comfortable set I\u2019ve ever tried.  \n\\>Works very well with any source.  \n\\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  \n\\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  \n\\>Clear, present, and layered mids.\n\n*-Cons:*  \n\\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  \n\\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  \n\\>Treble a little compressed.  \n\\>The cable slider doesn\u2019t stay fixed.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.\n\nThe price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65\u20ac**.\n\nDespite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn\u2019t have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.\n\nMy surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle\u2026 but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.\n\n**Will they meet my tastes?**\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the **package contents:**\n\n\\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  \n\\-User **manual**.  \n\\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  \n\\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  \n\\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  \n\\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  \n\\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.\n\n**They look comfortable, right?**\n\nThis is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.\n\nThe answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn\u2019t have started better.\n\nThe capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone\u2019s auricle and ear canal.\n\nFor this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.\n\nThe cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn\u2019t tangle, and doesn\u2019t pull by catching on your clothing.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn\u2019t fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.\n\n**Technical aspects:**\n\n\\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  \n\\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  \n\\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  \n\\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz\n\nThe **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.\n\nI would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nThese **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.\n\nMy experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.\n\nI could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone\u2019s intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.\n\nHowever, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.\n\n*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn\u2019t the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.\n\n*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn\u2019t interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.\n\n*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.\n\n*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don\u2019t feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.\n\n*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.\n\n*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don\u2019t need more, nor do I want it.\n\n*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors\u2019 tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.\n\n*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.\n\n*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.\n\n**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.\n\nRegarding **layering**: I don\u2019t know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can\u2019t believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.\n\nI encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)\n\nThe source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.\n\nIn the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.\n\nIn *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn\u2019t be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.\n\nRegarding Kratos\u2019 very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.\n\nIn the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn\u2019t the highest resolution experience I\u2019ve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.\n\nSpeaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.\n\nThe child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.\n\nContinuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.\n\nAnd let\u2019s go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it\u2019s the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*\n\nWell, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.\n\nNevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn\u2019t the best for purists since listening wasn\u2019t fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI don\u2019t want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I\u2019ve tested. At least up to the **100\u20ac/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what\u2019s the point of spending more money?\n\nI acknowledge it isn\u2019t perfect. In fact, technically, it\u2019s inferior to two other competitors in its price range I\u2019ve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I\u2019m not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.\n\nThey have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn\u2019t hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.\n\nMy sincerest congratulations to the brand.\n\nThank you for reading if you\u2019ve made it this far.\n\n**See you in the next review.**\n\n**Greetings!**",

      "selftext": "\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about clothes and jeans jeans here, so I wanted to share a few insights I\u2019ve picked up after comparing multiple pairs of Levi\u2019s jeans over the years.\n\nTo start with, Levi\u2019s has a bunch of fits, 501, 505, 511, etc. But here\u2019s the catch:\nNot all Levi\u2019s are made equal, even within the same model number. You can get two pairs of 511s that look similar but feel completely different in quality and durability.\n\nWhat really affects longevity\n\nThe #1 factor in how long jeans last is the cotton percentage.\n\t\u2022\t100% cotton jeans will last the longest.\n\t\u2022\tStretch jeans (with elastane/spandex) are more comfortable but wear out faster.\n\nIf you care about longevity, look for 98\u2013100% cotton.\nIf you prioritize comfort and flexibility, a bit of stretch (1\u20132% elastane) is fine; just know they won\u2019t age as gracefully.\n\n\nCountry of manufacture (based on my experience)\n\nAssuming similar cotton content, I\u2019ve noticed quality differences roughly as:\nEgypt > Vietnam > Sri Lanka/Bangladesh \u2248 India\n\nThe Egypt made Levi\u2019s in particular stand out, the denim feels thicker, stitching is cleaner, and overall QC is better.\n\nA few telltale signs of the \u201cpremium\u201d Egyptian made Levi\u2019s 501s:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cLevi\u2019s Premium\u201d tag on the waistband\n\t\u2022\tLeather patch (vs paper)\n\t\u2022\tCopper rivets (vs steel)\n\t\u2022\tCapital \u201cE\u201d on the red Levi\u2019s tab\n\nThese usually have a slightly higher MRP and are harder to find on sale but in my opinion, they\u2019re worth it for the longevity.\n\nHow to make your jeans last longer (brand agnostic tips)\n\t\u2022\tDon\u2019t hang jeans by the belt loop it stretches the fabric.\n\t\u2022\tWash less often (every few weeks is fine unless visibly dirty).\n\t\u2022\tHang them in the sun for a few hours to freshen them up.\n\t\u2022\tAlways wash inside out and air dry (no dryer!).\n\t\u2022\tRotate between 2\u20133 pairs to let the fabric rest and recover.\n\n(Some people even put jeans in a freezer overnight to kill odors. I haven\u2019t tried it myself but apparently it works.)\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you want your Levi\u2019s (or any jeans) to last:\n\t\u2022\tGo for high-cotton content (98\u2013100%)\n\t\u2022\tWatch out for where they\u2019re made. Egypt-made Levi\u2019s are top notch\n\t\u2022\tTake care of them properly\n\nFrugality isn\u2019t just about spending less, it\u2019s about spending smart on things that last.\n\nEdit: multiple comments on 98-100% cotton models. Current Levi\u2019s models that I have in 98-100% cotton include 501, 551Z, 555, 511, 65504. Some of these styles have further variations so plz do your due diligence.  ",

      "title": "Himalayan Distillery Ltd: Scale, Efficiency, and Market Dominance",
      "selftext": "For over a decade, *Himalayan Distillery Limited (HDL)* has occupied an almost legendary space in the Nepalese equity landscape. With combined sales from brands like Golden Oak, Black Oak, and Blue Oak taking over 50% share in the whiskey market, it's a company whose brand power extends beyond its balance sheet. As of FY 2081/82 Q4, HDL isn\u2019t merely a beverage producer; it has evolved into a capital-efficient, free-cash-flow-generating compounder that commands both retail devotion and institutional curiosity.\n\nBut behind the fanfare, the company\u2019s financial anatomy reveals more than just growth, it illustrates *how scale converts into financial leverage in a debt-free balance sheet.*\n\n# 1. Growth Profile: Volume Expansion Meets Margin Discipline\n\nRevenue surged **73.3% YoY** to **Rs. 7.20 billion**, a near-vertical acceleration in topline unseen in HDL\u2019s recent history. This expansion wasn\u2019t driven by one-off licensing or export anomalies but by broad-based volume growth in spirits and complementary categories, signaling brand elasticity across income segments.\n\nGross profit rose **76.07%**, reflecting both operating leverage and disciplined cost control despite inflationary input cycles. The gross margin (\\~30%) remained structurally consistent, implying price power rather than input softness as the primary growth vector.\n\n# 2. Profitability: When Fixed Costs Flatten, Margins Explode\n\nOperating profit remained nearly flat YoY at Rs. 1.29 billion, indicating reinvestment or timing of expense recognition in the latest quarter. However, *net profit* catapulted **170.01% YoY** to Rs. **953.26 million**, a pure reflection of operational scaling, tax efficiency, and cost normalization.\n\nEPS more than doubled to **Rs. 31.02**, from **Rs. 13.21** last year, a rare expansion in both earnings and equity base. This reflects the paradoxical balance between **15% capital expansion** and **135% earnings growth** \u2014 essentially, HDL\u2019s growth rate is outpacing its equity dilution by a factor of nine.\n\n# 3. Balance Sheet Strength: A Debt Free Fortress\n\nHDL maintains **zero borrowings**. Total equity rose **24.87%**, supported by a **64.21% jump in reserves** \\- the retained earnings now provide internal growth capital.\n\n**Book Value per share** increased to **Rs. 135.84**, up from Rs. 125.10. Though not extreme, this book accretion highlights a business compounding capital through reinvestment rather than leverage.\n\nTotal assets reached **Rs. 4.57 billion**, with current assets expanding 28.11%. Meanwhile, current liabilities grew 35%, partly reflecting higher working capital throughput in line with sales expansion rather than liquidity stress. HDL\u2019s current ratio remains comfortably above 4, underscoring strong short-term solvency.\n\n# 4. Return Metrics: ROE in Expansion Mode\n\nROE doubled from **10.56%** to **22.83%**, approaching the elite class of Nepalese listed companies. This improvement is primarily operational via *margin expansion and asset turnover* rather than financial leverage.\n\nThe combination of 22%+ ROE with zero debt indicates HDL is now entering a self-sustaining compounding cycle: high returns reinvested into a widening moat.\n\n# 5. Cash Flow Reality Check\n\nFrom the cash flow data:\n\n|Fiscal Year|Operating CF (Rs)|Investing CF (Rs)|Free Cash Flow (approx.)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|080/81|1,474,116,989|\\-348,296,539|\u2248 1.13 billion|\n|081/82|768,623,311|\\-251,974,769|\u2248 517 million|\n\nFree cash flow has normalized to around half a billion rupees, still robust relative to net income. This temporary moderation suggests capital expenditure was directed toward scaling production and distribution reinforcing long-term sustainability rather than indicating weakness.\n\nThe FCF-to-Net Income ratio remains healthy (\u224854%), and given HDL\u2019s capital-light expansion model, this ratio should rebound above 70% once reinvestment cycles stabilize.\n\n# 6. Valuation and Investor Psychology\n\nAt a normalized EPS of Rs. 31, HDL\u2019s intrinsic valuation bandwidth depends on sentiment-driven P/E expansion. During bullish liquidity cycles, HDL\u2019s P/E historically stretches to **140\u2013150x**, but its sustainable mid-cycle P/E sits between **45\u201360x**, implying a fair value corridor between **Rs. 1,400\u20131,850 per share** under conservative assumptions.\n\nIf revenue growth sustains at even 20\u201325% with stable margins, HDL\u2019s forward EPS could surpass Rs. 40 in the next two fiscal years - pushing long-term fair value into Rs. 5,000+ territory is P/E gets to 150x during bull-phase euphoria.\n\n# 7. Critical Risks\n\n* Overreliance on domestic consumption cycles.\n* Regulatory volatility in excise duties and licensing.\n* Brand concentration risk - high dependency on premium spirit categories.\n* Margin compression if input inflation resurges without parallel pricing power.\n\nHimalayan Distillery Ltd\u2019s recent announcement of a **25 % total distribution** comprising a **20 % bonus share issue** and only **5 % cash dividend -** signals a deliberate allocation strategy. By favouring bonus shares over cash payout the company retains more cash internally while still rewarding shareholders, implying management believes the firm can reinvest retained capital at a return exceeding what investors would earn via bank fixed-deposits or risk-free alternatives. In effect, the mix suggests HDL is expressing confidence that its growth ambitions - through capacity build-out, brand expansion or margin enhancement will deliver investors superior long-term returns over what a pure cash payout policy would offer.\n\nHDL now represents the archetype of a **\u201cNepali compounder\u201d** , a business that generates durable earnings without leverage, converts profits into cash, and maintains a structural moat through brand dominance.\n\nThe fiscal year 2081/82 marks the company\u2019s transition from linear growth to compounding efficiency. If free cash flow sustains, HDL may emerge not just as a cyclical beverage producer but as Nepal\u2019s first large-scale consumer staple compounder - the kind of company that defines entire bull markets.",

      "title": "KEI Industries vs Polycab India: Comparative Analysis of India's Wire & Cable Giants",
      "selftext": "Financial Performance Overview\n\nBoth KEI Industries and Polycab India delivered robust performances in the first half of FY26, though with distinct margin profiles and profitability trajectories that reflect fundamentally different strategic priorities.\n\n**Revenue Growth Dynamics**\n\nKEI Industries posted H1 FY26 revenue of Rs 5,317 crore, growing 22.3% year-on-year, slightly outpacing Polycab's 21.4% growth. In Q2 FY26 specifically, KEI achieved 19.4% revenue growth to Rs 2,726 crore, while Polycab grew 17.8% to Rs 6,477 crore. Both companies are exceeding their own guidance, with KEI's performance surpassing its 18% full-year growth target and Polycab maintaining momentum despite operating on a significantly larger revenue base of Rs 22,008 crore in FY25 versus KEI's Rs 9,736 crore.\u200b\n\n**Profitability and Margin Architecture**\n\nThe profitability gap between the two companies reveals a critical strategic differentiation. Polycab's Q2 FY26 EBITDA margin of 15.8% substantially exceeds KEI's 11.4%, a gap of 440 basis points. This differential persists at the PAT level, where Polycab achieved 10.7% versus KEI's 7.5%.\u200b\n\nMore striking is the growth momentum in profitability: Polycab's Q2 EBITDA surged 62% year-on-year compared to KEI's 31% growth, while PAT growth stood at 56% versus 31% respectively. Polycab's superior operating leverage, favorable product mix toward higher-margin SKUs, and premiumization strategy in both wires (Class 2 premium wires) and cables enabled sequential margin expansion of 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter. KEI maintained relatively stable margins with a modest 20 basis point year-on-year improvement.\u200b\n\n**Market Positioning and Scale**\n\nThe scale differential is substantial: Polycab commands a market capitalization of Rs 1.15 lakh crore versus KEI's Rs 39,000 crore. Polycab holds approximately 26-27% market share in India's organized cables and wires sector compared to KEI's \\~7% overall and 12% in the institutional segment. This translates to Polycab's dominant position with over 4,300 distributors and 2.05 lakh retail outlets versus KEI's 2,100 dealer network.\u200b\n\n# Strategic Positioning and Growth Philosophies\n\n**Horizontal Diversification vs Vertical Specialization**\n\nPolycab has pursued aggressive horizontal diversification through its Fast-Moving Electrical Goods (FMEG) segment, which now contributes 7-8% of revenue and turned profitable for the third consecutive quarter in Q2 FY26. The FMEG portfolio spans fans, LED lighting, switches, solar products, and conduits, with solar emerging as the fastest-growing category\u2014nearly doubling year-on-year and poised to become the largest FMEG category by FY26.\u200b\n\nKEI Industries, conversely, maintains a purist cables and wires focus with 94% of revenue from this core segment, deliberately eschewing FMEG diversification. The company's vertical specialization extends to backward integration through in-house PVC compound manufacturing operating at 70-75% utilization, enhancing cost efficiency and margin sustainability.\u200b\n\n**Export Orientation: Divergent Trajectories**\n\nKEI's export strategy represents perhaps its most aggressive differentiation lever. Export revenue in H1 FY26 reached Rs 757 crore, more than doubling from Rs 346 crore in H1 FY25\u2014a stunning 119% year-on-year growth. Exports now constitute approximately 16% of revenue, with management targeting 25-30% within three to five years.\u200b\n\nPolycab's international business, while growing steadily at 25% year-on-year, contributes only 6.5% to consolidated revenue. The company targets export contribution of around 10% by FY30 under Project Spring. This measured approach reflects Polycab's strategic calculus that domestic market share gains and FMEG scaling offer superior risk-adjusted returns.\u200b\n\n**Geographic and Channel Strategy**\n\nKEI's channel mix has shifted decisively toward B2C, with dealer network sales reaching 54% of revenue in H1 FY26 versus 47% a year earlier\u2014aligned with its target of 50-55% retail contribution by FY27. Institutional sales (B2B including exports) comprise 42%, down from 44%. The margin differential between B2C and B2B/export sales is minimal at approximately 0.5%, allowing KEI flexibility in capacity allocation.\u200b\n\nPolycab's channel strategy leverages its unparalleled distribution strength with 4,300+ distributors versus KEI's 2,100. The company's 95-98% on-time-in-full (OTIF) delivery accuracy, enabled by advanced supply chain management systems and 52 warehouses, creates formidable switching costs for distributors. This operational excellence in distribution forms a genuine competitive moat.\u200b\n\n# Operational Deep Dive\n\n**Segment-wise Performance Dynamics**\n\nWithin cables and wires, both companies experienced robust growth, though composition differs meaningfully. KEI's wires and cables business grew 22% year-on-year in Q2 FY26, with particularly strong performance in Extra High Voltage (EHV) cables. The company's copper cables share increased to 45% from 42%, driven by export market demand, while aluminum cables dominate domestic institutional sales at 55%.\u200b\n\nPolycab's Wires & Cables segment achieved 21% year-on-year growth in Q2 FY26, with high-teen volume expansion even on a high base. Both cables and wires grew strongly, with cables growth outpacing wires\u2014a positive mix shift given cables typically command higher margins.\u200b\n\nKEI's institutional cable sales (including EHV and exports) grew 23% year-on-year in Q2 FY26, while retail channel growth was 17%. Within institutional, domestic business showed moderate growth while exports and EHV cables surged. The EPC segment, which KEI is strategically de-emphasizing, declined 23% year-on-year.\u200b\n\nPolycab's EPC segment similarly declined 19% year-on-year to Rs 402 crore in Q2 FY26, impacted by slower RDSS (Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme) order execution. However, Polycab's Rs 6,448 crore BharatNet contract with BSNL\u2014spanning three years of construction and ten years of maintenance\u2014provides substantial revenue visibility and marks its evolution toward becoming a complete infrastructure solutions provider.\u200b\n\n**Margin Drivers and Trade-offs**\n\nPolycab's superior margins reflect multiple factors: operating leverage from larger scale, favorable business mix with higher premium product penetration, and pricing discipline during raw material inflation. The company successfully passed copper and aluminum price increases to distributors in Q2 FY26, maintaining margin integrity.\u200b\n\nKEI's margin profile reflects trade-offs from aggressive capacity expansion and network building. The company maintains that sustainable EBITDA margins of 11-11.5% are achievable in FY26-27, with potential for 100-150 basis point improvement post-Sanand plant commissioning due to scale benefits and operational leverage.\u200b\n\nPolycab guides for long-term W&C EBITDA margins of 11-13% and FMEG margins of 8-10% by FY30, currently exceeding these targets. This conservative guidance suggests management is consciously building buffer for potential competitive intensity or commodity volatility.\u200b\n\n**Capacity Utilization and Expansion**\n\nKEI's capacity utilization in Q2 FY26 stood at approximately 78% for cables, 65% for house wires, and 85% for stainless steel wires. The company completed brownfield expansions at Chinchpada and Pathredi plants in H1 FY25, adding capacity for wires and LT cables.\u200b\n\nThe strategic centerpiece is KEI's Rs 1,800-1,900 crore Sanand greenfield project in Gujarat, targeting annual revenue potential of Rs 6,000 crore once fully operational. Phase 1 focusing on LT/HT cables commenced in October 2025, with complete commissioning expected by Q1 FY27. The plant's proximity to Gujarat's ports and copper suppliers optimizes logistics and procurement costs, particularly benefiting export-oriented production.\u200b\n\nPolycab's capacity expansion occurs across multiple existing facilities with planned capex of Rs 6,000-8,000 crore over FY26-30 under Project Spring, translating to Rs 1,200-1,600 crore annually. This includes EHV plant expansion in Gujarat and investments in backward integration and FMEG capacity. The distributed approach minimizes concentration risk while leveraging existing manufacturing footprints.\u200b\n\n# Industry Context and Structural Drivers\n\n**Market Structure and Consolidation Dynamics**\n\nIndia's cables and wires market, valued at approximately Rs 80,000 crore, remains highly fragmented with around 400 players and 30% unorganized presence. No single player holds more than 15-20% market share in the overall market. This fragmentation presents consolidation opportunities for organized players with strong brands, distribution reach, and quality credentials.\u200b\n\nThe organized sector is projected to grow at 1.5-2x India's real GDP growth, implying 7-9% CAGR through 2030-32. Both companies target outperformance: KEI aims for 20% CAGR over the next 3-5 years, while Polycab targets 1.5x industry growth (15-20% CAGR).\u200b\n\n**Government Infrastructure Thrust**\n\nMassive government infrastructure spending provides structural tailwinds. The Union Budget FY26 allocated Rs 9.12 lakh crore to infrastructure, a 25% year-on-year increase. The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) with Rs 3 lakh crore outlay focuses on distribution network modernization, transformer upgrades, and smart meter installation\u2014all cable-intensive applications.\u200b\n\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) projects, combined with initiatives like PM Suryodaya Yojana (Rs 20,000 crore for rooftop solar), FAME-II for EV infrastructure, and BharatNet for rural broadband, create multi-year demand visibility. Data center proliferation, with cables accounting for 8-9% of project costs, represents another high-growth application.\u200b\n\n**Renewable Energy and Sector Evolution**\n\nIndia's 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030, including 280 GW solar and 140 GW wind, drives specialized cable demand including solar E-beam cables, high-temperature resistant wires, and high-voltage transmission cables. Solar installations require high-quality, low-loss cabling systems, with the solar cables market expected to expand significantly.\u200b\n\nGovernment allocations for renewable energy increased from Rs 10,222 crore in FY24 to Rs 26,549 crore in FY26, reflecting commitment to accelerating deployment. Both KEI and Polycab are positioning to capture this opportunity, with Polycab already installing 6.1 MW solar capacity and 8.1 MW wind capacity at its own facilities.\u200b\n\n**New Competitive Entrants**\n\nThe entry of conglomerates\u2014Adani Group, Aditya Birla Group (via UltraTech Cement with Rs 1,800 crore investment), and others\u2014has heightened competitive concerns. UltraTech's announcement triggered volatility in incumbent players' stock prices. However, both KEI and Polycab management express confidence that the expanding market accommodates new entrants while their established distribution, brand equity, and technical capabilities provide defensibility.\u200b\n\n# Risk Factors and Vulnerabilities\n\n**Raw Material Volatility**\n\nCopper and aluminum constitute 40-60% of cable raw material costs. In Q2 FY26, average copper and aluminum prices rose 6-9% quarter-on-quarter and 10-14% year-on-year. Additionally, rupee-dollar exchange rate fluctuations (ranging Rs 48-60+ per USD historically) amplify volatility.\u200b\n\nKEI maintains net foreign currency receivables as imports of metals are lower than exports, typically generating forex gains but exposing the company to sharp currency movements without systematic hedging. Polycab's larger scale and diversified vendor base provide somewhat better negotiating leverage on metal procurement.\u200b\n\n**Working Capital Management**\n\nWorking capital efficiency represents a crucial operational metric. KEI's debtor days improved to 68 days in FY24 from 74 days in FY23 and 90 days in FY22, driven by increasing retail sales proportion and vendor financing arrangements. Creditor days increased to 60 days, supporting the working capital cycle.\u200b\n\nPolycab's working capital days stood at 40-45 days with expectations of normalization to 50-55 days, indicating tighter inventory management and collection efficiency. The company's channel financing initiatives and advanced inventory optimization systems provide structural advantages.\u200b\n\n**Execution Risk on Capacity Expansion**\n\nKEI's Rs 1,800-1,900 crore Sanand project, while strategically vital, introduces execution risk. The company has already invested approximately Rs 1,100 crore with Rs 500-600 crore planned in FY26 and Rs 300-400 crore in FY27. The phased commissioning\u2014LT/HT in Q3-Q4 FY26 and EHV by H1 FY27\u2014requires careful ramp-up to achieve projected utilization and returns.\u200b\n\nPolycab's distributed expansion across existing facilities mitigates single-project risk but requires coordination across multiple sites. The company's track record of successful Project LEAP (exceeding Rs 22,000 crore revenue target ahead of FY26) provides confidence in execution capabilities.\u200b\n\n# Forward-Looking Industry Perspective\n\n**Market Share Trajectory**\n\nPolycab's stated objective under Project Spring includes further market share gains from its current 26-27% in the organized sector. The company's comprehensive portfolio, unmatched distribution reach, and brand strength position it to consolidate smaller players and capture unorganized market share.\u200b\n\nKEI's path to market share expansion relies on export penetration (targeting 25-30% of revenue), retail network densification (adding dealers in untapped markets), and leveraging Sanand's export-oriented capacity. The company's institutional segment expertise, particularly in EHV cables where it holds stronger positioning, provides differentiation.\u200b\n\n**Profitability Evolution**\n\nThe margin convergence or divergence trajectory between the two companies will reveal much about competitive dynamics. If KEI successfully scales exports and commissions Sanand with minimal margin dilution, achieving 12-13% EBITDA margins by FY28 appears feasible. Conversely, if Polycab maintains 15%+ margins while growing 15-20% annually, it reinforces the premium valuation multiple the market assigns (PE of 46.8x versus KEI's 49.4x).\u200b\n\nFMEG's profitability improvement to 8-10% EBITDA margins will be critical for Polycab's valuation narrative. The segment's achievement of profitability for three consecutive quarters demonstrates proof of concept, but scaling to Rs 5,000+ crore while maintaining margins requires continued execution.\u200b\n\n**Technological and Product Evolution**\n\nData center cabling, EV charging infrastructure cables, and renewable energy-specific products represent high-growth, higher-margin niches. Both companies are developing specialized offerings, though Polycab's resource base enables faster R&D investment. KEI's focus on product certifications across multiple export markets creates barriers to entry for competitors.\u200b\n\nThe shift toward higher voltage applications (EHV cables for transmission) and specialized industrial cables offers margin enhancement opportunities. KEI's strategic focus on EHV capacity at Sanand aligns with this trend, while Polycab's Gujarat EHV plant expansion similarly positions for transmission sector growth.\u200b\n\n**Export Market Dynamics**\n\nKEI's aggressive export thrust\u2014targeting 25-30% of revenue versus current 16%\u2014represents a fundamental strategic bet. Success hinges on product approvals in target countries, pricing competitiveness versus Chinese and other Asian manufacturers, and sustained demand in key markets (Australia, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Nigeria, Ghana).\u200b\n\nPolycab's measured 10% export target reflects strategic conservatism, prioritizing domestic market share gains and FMEG scaling. The company exports to 80+ countries but maintains disciplined approach to avoid margin-dilutive market entry.\u200b\n\n# Competitive Positioning: Multiple Paths to Success\n\nThe KEI-Polycab comparison illuminates how different strategic philosophies can coexist successfully within the same industry. Polycab exemplifies the dominant incumbent leveraging scale, distribution excellence, and horizontal diversification to cement market leadership and command premium margins. KEI represents the focused challenger pursuing vertical specialization, export expansion, and operational efficiency to drive above-industry growth from a smaller base.\n\nNeither strategy is inherently superior; each presents distinct risk-reward profiles. Polycab's diversification into FMEG creates revenue streams less tied to project cycles but requires sustained marketing investment and consumer brand building in competitive categories. KEI's export concentration creates growth optionality but exposes the company to geopolitical risks, currency volatility, and international competitive dynamics.\n\nThe margin differential\u2014440 basis points at EBITDA level and 320 basis points at PAT level\u2014reflects scale, product mix, and strategic choices around network investment intensity. Whether this gap narrows as KEI scales or widens as Polycab compounds its advantages will define the competitive narrative through 2030.\u200b\n\nIndia's cables and wires industry growth trajectory, projected at 7-9% CAGR through 2032-33, driven by infrastructure investment, renewable energy adoption, and electrification drives, offers ample headroom for both companies to achieve ambitious growth targets. The question is not whether one company will \"win\" but rather which strategic path delivers superior risk-adjusted returns for shareholders\u2014a question that can only be answered through execution over the next 3-5 years.\u200b\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Taylor Sheridan to Depart Paramount for NBCUniversal",
      "selftext": "Written by\nBranden Zavaleta\n\nTaylor Sheridan, the creator behind Paramount\u2019s Yellowstone franchise and its growing constellation of spinoffs, will exit the studio when his current commitments expire, signing a sweeping film and television deal with NBCUniversal.\n\n##A Two-Track Deal\n\n[According to Puck](https://puck.news/taylor-sheridan-is-leaving-paramount-for/), Sheridan has been unhappy with Paramount\u2019s new management and has finalized an nearly eight-year film pact at Universal that begins when his Paramount deal ends in March. In addition, a new five-year television overall will activate following the end of his current Paramount agreement in 2028, shifting Sheridan\u2019s small-screen development exclusively to NBCU platforms, including Peacock and NBC.\n\nAs part of the transition, Sheridan\u2019s production company, 101 Studios, is expected to move its output to Universal as rights windows open. Financial details were not disclosed, but sources describe the terms as competitive with top-tier Hollywood mega-deals.\n\n##Frustrations at Paramount\n\nSheridan\u2019s exit follows months of quiet friction between the creator and Paramount\u2019s newly installed leadership after David Ellison\u2019s Skydance acquisition of the company in August. Several executives who had championed Sheridan\u2019s work were either removed or moved aside in the subsequent reorganization, leaving the creative team that originally courted him diminished.\n\nBudget scrutiny has also intensified. Incoming streaming chief Cindy Holland has pushed for tighter cost controls amid Paramount+ restructuring, and Sheridan\u2019s productions \u2014 including Yellowstone prequels and the espionage drama Lioness \u2014 have regularly commanded premium budgets due to marquee casting and on-location shooting. The studio\u2019s interest in attaching itself to an older Sheridan film script at Warner Bros. also reportedly caused friction.\n\nSheridan, whose shows consistently chart near the top of Nielsen rankings, was said to be unsettled by the signals coming from the reconfigured regime, even as Paramount continued to praise his creative output publicly.\n\n##Courting a Franchise Builder\n\nSheridan\u2019s team quietly began taking meetings earlier this year, meeting with reps across streamers and legacy studios. NBCUniversal chair Donna Langley emerged as a compelling advocate. Langley, now overseeing both film and television, has cultivated a reputation as a destination for marquee filmmakers, counting long-running partnerships with Steven Spielberg, Jordan Peele and Christopher Nolan.\n\nSheridan, an Oscar-nominated screenwriter before his rise as a television powerhouse, was reportedly drawn to the notion of being treated as an elite filmmaker with latitude across mediums. Industry observers point to the precedent set by multi-decade NBCU relationships with figures like Dick Wolf and Lorne Michaels \u2014 another factor that appealed to Sheridan.\n\n##What Paramount Retains\n\nDespite Sheridan\u2019s departure, Paramount maintains long-term rights to the television series he delivers until 2028, including currently airing seasons of *Tulsa King*, *Mayor of Kingstown* and reality competition entry *The Road*. Over the next year, the studio also plans to roll out multiple Sheridan-originated projects already in production, including additional installments of *Landman*, the *Yellowstone* follow-ups *Dutton Ranch* and *Y: Marshals*, new episodes of *Lioness* and a New Orleans-set crime drama titled *NOLA King*.\n\nThe studio can continue building Yellowstone spinoffs going forward. But Sheridan\u2019s creative fingerprints \u2014 particularly his thematic bent toward frontier mythology, institutional power and American identity \u2014 have become an identifiable brand for Paramount, leaving questions about its long-term replacement strategy.\n\n##Looking Ahead\n\nSheridan is expected to continue delivering the output required under his current Paramount agreement, with the new film partnership launching first in early 2026. His television move will activate two years later, marking a clean platform shift.\nParamount, meanwhile, faces the prospect of concluding a decade-defining creative era just as its parent company navigates layoffs, restructuring and streaming recalibration.\n\nFor Sheridan, the next chapter offers an opportunity to expand beyond the frontier-adjacent stories that built his name\u2014while once again becoming a very large fish in a carefully chosen pond.\n\n\nhttps://thephrasemaker.com/2025/10/27/taylor-sheridan-to-depart-paramount-for-nbcuniversal/\n\n\n",

      "title": "Why Every Business Needs a Skilled Cyber Security Developer in 2025?",
      "selftext": "**The Digital Age Comes with Digital Dangers**\n\nWe live in an era where business success is built on technology \u2014 and threatened by it too. From e-commerce and cloud computing to digital banking and remote work, nearly every business operation now relies on online systems.\n\nBut with that convenience comes risk. Cyberattacks are increasing in scale, complexity, and frequency, targeting not just large corporations but small and medium-sized businesses as well. A single security breach can lead to financial loss, data theft, and long-term damage to a company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThat\u2019s why 2025 isn\u2019t just another year of technological advancement \u2014 it\u2019s a year where cyber security development has become a business survival strategy.\n\nEvery organization \u2014 regardless of size or industry \u2014 needs a **skilled Cyber Security Developer** to design, monitor, and maintain the digital shields that keep their systems safe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The New Face of Cyber Threats in 2025**\n\nCyberattacks are no longer just about hacking passwords or infecting computers with viruses. Modern attackers utilize AI-driven phishing campaigns, ransomware-as-a-service, and sophisticated social engineering techniques to exploit even the most minor system weaknesses.\n\nBusinesses face threats such as:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Data breaches** compromising sensitive client or employee information.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Ransomware attacks** that lock entire networks until payments are made.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Cloud vulnerabilities** due to misconfigurations or insecure APIs.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Insider threats**, both intentional and accidental.\n\nThese evolving risks require proactive defense \u2014 not just software patches or antivirus scans. This is where cyber security developers come in. They don\u2019t just detect attacks; they design systems that can anticipate and withstand them.\n\n\n\n**The Role of a Cyber Security Developer**\n\nA [**Cyber Security Developer**](https://www.webtrills.com/software-for-cybersecurity)[ ](https://www.webtrills.com/software-for-cybersecurity)is not your average IT technician. They\u2019re a hybrid of programmer, analyst, and strategist \u2014 professionals who integrate security directly into the DNA of every digital product or platform.\n\nTheir responsibilities include:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Writing secure code:** Ensuring applications are built with security measures from the start.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Conducting vulnerability assessments:** Identifying potential risks before they can be exploited.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Implementing encryption and access controls:** Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized users.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Building automated monitoring tools:** Detecting unusual activity and preventing breaches in real time.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **Collaborating with DevOps teams:** Embedding security throughout the software development lifecycle (DevSecOps).\n\nA good cybersecurity developer doesn\u2019t wait for a threat to appear \u2014 they anticipate it, neutralize it, and continuously improve systems to stay ahead of future attacks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Why Businesses Can\u2019t Afford to Ignore Cyber Security Development**\n\nIn 2025, **cyber security is no longer a luxury \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity**. Businesses that invest in skilled developers and security infrastructure gain significant advantages beyond safety:\n\n\u00a0\n\n# 1. Protection of Sensitive Data\n\nFrom customer information to financial records, data is the new currency. A cyber security developer ensures that data stays encrypted, private, and inaccessible to outsiders.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# 2. Maintaining Customer Trust\n\nOne breach can destroy years of brand loyalty. Secure systems show customers that their privacy and safety matter \u2014 and that\u2019s a powerful trust builder.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Cost Savings from Prevention\n\nThe cost of a single data breach can reach millions in recovery, downtime, and lost business. Investing in proactive cyber security is far more affordable than dealing with the aftermath of an attack.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Compliance with Global Standards\n\nRegulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA demand strict data protection practices. Cyber security development ensures your business stays compliant \u2014 avoiding fines and legal complications.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# 5.\u00a0\u00a0 Staying Competitive in the Digital Era\n\nBusinesses that prioritize cyber resilience attract more clients, investors, and partnerships. In competitive industries, security can be a differentiator \u2014 not just a defense mechanism.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The Growing Demand for Cyber Security Developers**\n\nAccording to industry forecasts, the demand for cyber security professionals will rise by over 30% in the next five years, one of the fastest-growing tech career fields.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy? Because businesses are realizing that reactive measures no longer work. They need skilled developers who can build secure digital architectures, write hardened code, and respond to threats in real time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA **Cyber Security Development Company** bridges this talent gap by offering specialized expertise, tools, and experience. These companies help organizations of all sizes deploy robust security solutions tailored to their needs \u2014 from network monitoring systems to cloud security frameworks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**AI and Automation: The New Tools of Cyber Defense**\n\nIn 2025, artificial intelligence and automation are transforming how businesses fight cybercrime. AI algorithms can analyze massive volumes of data to detect suspicious behavior patterns faster than any human team.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example, AI-powered tools can:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Predict potential vulnerabilities before they\u2019re exploited.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Identify and isolate malware instantly.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Automate patch management and threat response.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, even with advanced technology, human expertise remains irreplaceable. Skilled cyber security developers are the ones who train these AI systems, interpret their results, and ensure they align with realworld security goals.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn short, AI strengthens cybersecurity **\u2014 but developers make it intelligent.**\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Cyber Security Is for Everyone \u2014 Not Just Tech Giants**\n\nA common misconception is that only large corporations need cyber protection. In truth, small and medium-sized businesses are now prime targets, often because attackers assume they lack robust defenses.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA 2025 business without a security plan is like a house with an open door. Whether you manage an ecommerce store, healthcare service, or real estate agency, your digital systems hold sensitive data that hackers want.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHiring or partnering with a Cyber Security Development Company ensures that your systems \u2014 from websites to mobile apps \u2014 are secured end-to-end.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The Human Factor: Why Skilled Developers Matter Most**\n\nEven the most advanced firewalls or software can\u2019t replace the insight and intuition of a trained cyber security developer. Technology evolves, but so do attackers \u2014 and human expertise is what keeps innovation on the right side of the line.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCyber security developers don\u2019t just protect networks; they build resilience into the very architecture of a business. They\u2019re the invisible guardians that keep operations running safely and smoothly every day.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# Conclusion:\u00a0\n\nAs businesses navigate the ever-changing digital landscape of 2025, one truth stands out: **cyber security is business security.** From protecting sensitive data to ensuring customer trust, skilled Cyber Security Developers are the foundation of every safe and successful organization. And when you need expertise that combines innovation, reliability, and deep technical knowledge \u2014 **Webtrills** delivers.\n\n\u00a0At [**Webtrills**](https://www.webtrills.com/software-for-cybersecurity)[,](https://www.webtrills.com/software-for-cybersecurity) we specialize in creating robust, AI-driven defense systems that empower businesses to stay secure and resilient.

      "title": "My Experience with Varicocele Embolization Today",
      "selftext": "I had my varicocele emoblization today and happy to say it went successfully, as far as the procedure itself.\n\nI've had a varicocele for years (since 2019). It got bigger as time went on. I was initially freaked out when it got big and went to a doctor because I thought it was testicular cancer. He said it wasn't cancer, but referred me to a urologist. I went to the urologist, he said it was a varicocele and if it wasn't causing any pain, then nothing to worry about. My wife and I are in our 40's and not having kids, so sperm production wasn't a factor for me. Well a couple of years after that, the pain kicked in. It got really bad. Classic varicocele symptoms, dull ache - worse in the middle of day or after exercise, heavy feeling in scrotum, big bag of worms, dull ache in lower left abdomen. So I went in for an ultrasound, they confirmed a Grade 3 varicocele - the urologist recommended surgery. He said in his 20 years of urology, it was in his top 3 for largest varicoceles he's ever seen. I waited years and couldn't take the pain, that's when I looked for alternatives because I did not want surgery.\n\nI had 3 options for interventional radiologists who do varicocele embolizations within 15 minutes of my house. One was brand new, so I passed. The second one had experience, so I saw her for a consult and didn't feel great about it and she had bad reviews, seemed like a total hack- she was closest to my house and the cheapest, but neither of those things factored into it for me - I'll pay more money and gladly drive extra to get it done right. Then I saw the third guy, 5.0 reviews, 15 minutes from my house, felt very good he knew what he was doing - so I went in with him. It took 2.5 months to get pre-authorization by insurance then scheduled the procedure for today. While waiting for insurance approval for the embolization, I got an MRV with and without contrast which again confirmed a varicocele and May-Thurner sydrome too.\n\nThe varicocele embolization happened today. It went super smooth. Got to the doctor's office at 7am. Took about an hour to get in a gown, take vitals, and get the IV ready on my wrist. I got an anxiety med, pain killer, and anti-nausea med for the procedure. They wheeled me in about 8am, the procedure took one hour. They went in through the neck - I felt nothing, they numbed the neck and I didn't even notice the numbing shot or anything else during the procedure. Nine coils were put in, plus schlerotherapy, plus a stent for the May-Thurner syndrome since that was 90% pinched shut. No nutracker syndrome. The doc confirmed everything was blocked off. They wheeled me to a bay for one hour of observation, gave me another dose of an anti-nausea med, and I was discharged at 10am.\n\nIt's about 13 hours later now. I napped about 4 hours throughout the day. No pain really. The neck is slightly sore where they inserted the catheter for the procedure - like a soreness after taking a vaccine shot. My lower left abdomen aches a little bit, like a soreness again. The worst part of it was the anxiety the day before and morning of. I kept myself distracted the month leading up to it - I only told my wife about the procedure. I didn't tell family until the day before so they couldn't continuously ask me about it. It helped keep the anxiety down (plus exericise, running).\n\nI plan to do an update post at maybe the 3 month mark and 6 month mark to see if the varicocele goes away.\n\nUpdate: Forgot to put this initially - varicocele was on the left side of the testicles only.",

I\u2019ll mostly use it for competitive play rather than AAA single-player titles.\n\nA few details about what I\u2019m looking for / my constraints:\n\t\u2022\tBudget: ~\u20ac400-500 (used/second-hand)\n\t\u2022\tTarget: 300+ FPS in CS2 (competitive settings)\n\t\u2022\tPrefer something with a decent GPU & CPU combo (not ultra-old)\n\t\u2022\tIt should be fairly portable (so I can move it around), but performance is the priority\n\t\u2022\tI can do some minor upgrades (RAM, storage) if needed, but ideally the machine should already be decent\n\t\u2022\tI\u2019m buying in Europe (so availability/shipping is a factor)\n\nQuestions for you experienced folks:\n\t\u2022\tWhat GPU + CPU combo in a used laptop would you recommend to reliably hit 300 FPS in CS2? (Examples: GTX/RTX series, older vs newer CPU generations)\n\t\u2022\tAre there specific laptop models or brands to watch out for (good value, good cooling, avoid major issues) in this price bracket?\n\t\u2022\tWhat specs (RAM, display refresh rate, cooling, thermals) should I prioritise for this kind of competitive use case?\n\t\u2022\tAny \u201cdeal breakers\u201d on used laptops (e.g., bad cooling that reduces FPS, battery health issues, weird weird quirks) that I should avoid or test when checking it in person?\n\t\u2022\tIf I have to choose between slightly better GPU vs slightly better CPU in this scenario, which would you pick for CS2?\n\nReally appreciate any advice, example builds or listings you\u2019ve seen that worked for this kind of use case! Thanks in advance!\n",

      "title": "ESG Investing: Is It Saving the Planet, or Just Company Reputations?",
      "selftext": "Imagine nearly $18.4 trillion flowing into 'sustainable' investments globally, as reported by Morningstar in 2024. Sounds incredibly hopeful, right? But as a quiet observer of financial currents, I often wonder: is all this 'green' money truly creating green impact, or is it mostly just polishing company reputations?\n\nESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing started with a noble idea: to look beyond just financial numbers and consider a company's impact on the planet, people, and governance for long-term sustainability. The UN's 2006 'Who Cares Wins' report even linked these factors to better financial performance. But lately, a shadow is growing over this trend.\n\nWe are seeing increasing accusations of 'greenwashing' (making unsubstantiated or misleading environmental claims). For instance, major asset managers like DWS Group faced intense scrutiny and regulatory investigations from June 2022 onwards, as reported by Reuters and Bloomberg. A striking benchmark from Reclaim Finance (2023) showed that 85% of investment funds claiming to be 'sustainable' still held investments in fossil fuel companies. It really makes you pause, doesn't it? Tariq Fancy, former CIO for Sustainable Investing at BlackRock, even called ESG a 'marketing exercise' that has 'swallowed the entire responsible investment industry.'\n\nA significant issue is the lack of standardization. ESG ratings from different agencies often show a correlation of only 0.53, much lower than the 0.99 for credit ratings (MIT Sloan, 2019). This means companies can sometimes cherry-pick metrics to look good, rather than adhering to universal standards. Professor George Serafeim of Harvard Business School stresses the 'urgent need for standardization and transparency.' In fact, a 2023 Deloitte survey found that around 68% of global investors believe companies are exaggerating their sustainability efforts, revealing a clear trust deficit.\n\nHere in India, ESG Assets Under Management (AUM - total value of assets managed) also grew significantly, from $10 billion in 2020 to over $20 billion by late 2023 (Morningstar India). Our markets regulator, SEBI, even mandated Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR - a framework for disclosing ESG performance) for top 1000 listed companies from FY 2022-23 to boost transparency. Yet, despite these efforts, Indian companies, especially in energy-intensive sectors, still face greenwashing accusations (The Economic Times, 2023). Sach yeh hai, sirf dikhane se kuch nahi hota.\n\nThe incentives for companies are clear: boosting brand image, attracting capital, and potentially even cutting operating costs. Bank of America Global Research (2020) suggested strong ESG practices can lead to up to 10% operating cost reduction and a 20% increase in valuations. And with 48% of consumers globally willing to pay more for sustainable products (IBM, 2022), there is a powerful market pull for companies to *appear* sustainable.\n\nMy sense is that ESG is a necessary, but still immature, framework. The core issue isn't the intent behind sustainability, but its current execution: a need for more focus on quantifiable impact, not just disclosure. It is a stepping stone towards real change, yes, but we must ensure it leads there, rather than just generating good press.\n\nAs investors and consumers, we must look beyond the glossy reports. Ask tough questions: What is the real, measurable impact of these initiatives? Where does the money truly go? What are your thoughts on ESG investing, especially here in India? Have you found any companies whose ESG efforts you genuinely trust, or do you feel it is largely a marketing facade? I would love to hear your experiences. #ESG #Investing #Greenwashing #SustainableFinance #India",

Well, the truck blew its 3rd turbo but this time the turbine went down the exhaust and damaged the DPF. The stealership quoted us 10K to replace it. We're currently using the truck cause well.... we need it. Our backup ambulance is also a 2013 F-450 6.7Ps. Which if I look at the truck wrong something breaks. I know 1 contributing factor is the fact we generally have a 5 min transport to the hospital. Then a 12 min drive to the station, the Exhaust isn't getting hot enough for passive regen. This means often we have to park the ambo outside and listen to a crying cow for 30 mins for it to regen. During these regens we cannot use the truck so when we get another call. Were left with calling for another ambulance which on busy days could be a 20 min wait.  Anyways here is where I turn to the Internet. I am currently writing an exemption request from 40 CFR 85.1716. Now what brand or even how do I go about deleting the DPF correctly? I know this is long but any help would be appreciated to get our ambulance working again.",

      "title": "How do I navigate buying a good new-to-me (used) washer & dryer after a 26-year Maytag relationship?",
      "selftext": "We bought a Maytag Neptune washer in early 1999, the version with no electronic display. First major appliance we ever bought. Less than a year later, we bought a matching dryer. This dynamic duo weathered cloth diapers for four kids and far outlasted my marriage, which ended in 2011. All of the previously diapered kids have grown up and moved away.\n\nI have lost track of all the parts I've replaced over the years, but the list would include the bearings, wax seal, and door gasket in the washer, and the heating element and all of the thermostats in the dryer, along with a bunch of other parts. At this point, I am pretty sure the washer needs a new water pump ($150+ replacement part). The dryer has been stuck on \"high temp\" since the last parts replacement (no temperature control option) and the \"more dry/less dry\" sensor no longer works (but it dries a load if you set it for 60 minutes).\n\nIn short, I am attached. I am not at all mechanically inclined. I just have more than my share of gumption, stubbornness, and a tight budget. I am probably way too proud of the fact that I've kept these machines running for so long.\n\nThe two appliance repair guys in the area who work on old Maytags both refuse to work with homeowners who have done any of their own work. I am not a difficult customer, but I always try to figure things out myself before I call for backup. I am careful, undo whatever I did that didn't work out, and don't leave messes for other people to clean up. But neither of these guys will touch a machine that has been DIY-serviced, and they were both very condescending when I asked for their help. So I can't even pay one to figure out whether it's worth it. (I live rurally so the options are few.)\n\nSo, I think it's time to move on. I can't afford to spend $150 on a part that I'm not 100% sure is the issue (or, worse, part of the issue). I'm short on time and tired of schlepping to the laundromat and paying 'mat prices.\n\nA friend is selling her used washer/dryer. I have a different friend who is willing to deliver the new-to-me units and take the old ones away for me. It feels like the right time to jump ship (it's been nearly 27 years...that's respectable, right??)\n\nMy Maytag washer is leaking and not spinning out properly, so I can't use it at all. That plus having a friend at hand willing to help transport and recycle tells me the time to let go is now. But I just have no idea what to look for or how to maximize confidence that I'm making a long-lived investment.\n\nI have NO IDEA how to assess used washers/dryers. We just got super lucky with those Neptunes, which cost a fortune at the time. Now they are like classic cars. I understand they don't make 'em like they used to. But to keep a classic car on the road, you need a good mechanic and a big wallet, or you really need to loooooooove doing mechanical work yourself and have a spare car for everyday use. I do not have a spare washer/dryer.\n\nI have heard modern machines only last 6 years on average.\n\nI cannot afford a new washer, let alone a new set. I could buy a used washer now and keep using my Maytag dryer on hot until it croaks, which would hopefully give me time to gather funds for a dryer purchase later, but I might lose the chance at help transporting / recycling the dryer if I wait. So I am tempted to look at sets already. Time is a factor.\n\nBuying my friend's used ones would be convenient, but my cellar is a challenge to get anything large into (down a narrow flight of stairs with no bulkhead) so I don't want to take a chance on a possible dud.\n\nWhat should I be looking for, especially under a time crunch? Brands, models, age? How do I assess whether a used machine is a good deal? How much is figure-out-able, and how much is just up to chance? WWYD?",

No. So let me tell them. \n\nThe phrase means you're not motivated by rivalry or winning against others, but rather by your own personal goals and progress. \nWhen you're not inspired by certain people, their achievements or successes don't serve as a motivator for you to compete and \"win\" against them, instead your drive comes from internal factors like personal growth and authenticity. \n\nWhich leads to a more cooperative approach, as your focus is on collaboration and self-improvement rather than outdoing others.\n\nWhich had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with selgo or her brand. \n\nSo hailey was spot on with her approach.

      "title": "Which soundbar is right for my home theater?",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone! I've been a home theater enthusiast for over 8 years now, and I wanted to share my experience about choosing the perfect soundbar. I know how overwhelming it can be when you're trying to upgrade your TV audio setup, especially with so many options out there.\n\nRecently, I spent countless hours researching soundbars for my living room setup, and I've learned quite a bit that might help you out. First things first - your room size matters a lot. If you've got a smaller space, a 2.1 channel soundbar might be all you need. But for larger rooms, you might want to consider a 5.1 or even a 7.1 channel system for that immersive surround sound experience.\n\nI personally went with a Dolby Atmos-enabled soundbar (you can check out some great options here: https://athometouch.com/soundbar), and let me tell you, the difference is night and day! The overhead sound effects make movie nights feel like you're in a real theater.\n\nHere's what I consider most important when choosing a soundbar:\n\n1. Room Size and Layout\n2. Budget (good ones range from $200-$1000+)\n3. Connection Options (HDMI, Optical, Bluetooth)\n4. Additional Features (Voice Control, WiFi streaming)\n5. Brand Reliability\n\nOne thing that often gets overlooked is the subwoofer situation. Some soundbars come with wireless subwoofers, while others let you add one later. If you're big on action movies or bass-heavy music, definitely consider a system with a good subwoofer.\n\nFor gaming, look for soundbars with low latency and HDMI 2.1 support. These features ensure your audio stays perfectly synced with what's happening on screen. Trust me, in fast-paced games, this makes a huge difference!\n\nI've found some really good deals at https://athometouch.com/soundbar - they've got a solid selection of soundbars ranging from budget-friendly to premium options.\n\nWhat about smart features? Most modern soundbars come with Alexa or Google Assistant built-in, which is super convenient for voice control and streaming music. But if you don't care about these features, you can save some money by going for a simpler model.\n\nOne pro tip: Don't just focus on the specs. Read user reviews about real-world performance and reliability. Sometimes a mid-range soundbar with great tuning can sound better than a more expensive one with fancy features you might never use.\n\nAnyone else here running a soundbar setup? I'd love to hear about your experiences and what factors influenced your choice!",

I got it back in 2018 because of the price and it has served me well and became one of my favorites to mess around on and travel with. Have a lot of sentimental feelings about that guitar because of the trips it\u2019s been on. \n\nI want something that I\u2019ll feel more comfortable throwing in the car for random trips and days out.\nI\u2019ve been curious about finding something even smaller than that 1/2 size.\n\nI\u2019ve looked into guitaleles which I really like the idea of and know that it\u2019s basically like playing a standard with a capo on the 5 fret. Transposing and factoring that in wouldn\u2019t be an issue for me but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something designed for standard tuning.\n\nLooking into some 1/4 size guitars. Feels like a silly question but can adults comfortably play those? My hands are probably more on the smaller size rather than large but have long skinny fingers so I feel like it shouldn\u2019t be an issue since I\u2019m already comfortable on the 1/2 size and function well on ukuleles and mandolins. Just wanted to check if that would work before spending any money on one. \n\nAnother question, can a guitalele be tuned down to standard if desired or would strings be too slack?",

Depending on where the journey takes us chemistry and attraction may play a factor as well but I value honesty, intelligence, loyalty and kindness the most. A sense of humor and wit is a HUGE bonus :)\n\n**My hobbies/interests:**\n\n**Cooking/Baking:** I am an avid steak lover. I literally have a costco membership just so I can buy certain steaks in bulk and regularly have wagyu in my freezer which I pull out on occasion. Not only do I adore cooking it but I enjoy going to steakhouses and want to try some of the ones I haven't yet. There are things I haven't cooked yet that I'd like to so if you have any interest or talent in the kitchen I'd definitely love to cook some things together like homemade pasta, chinese food, homemade dumplings, spring rolls, bread, etc...I also enjoy cooking for other people so that's always a possibility :)\n\n**Watching UFC:** I tend to watch 99% of PPVs and actually want to visit a live show again in the future. I just haven't found many people who are as passionate as me.\n\n**Investing:** I am not a major finance person by any means but I like the idea of working towards having passive income so I am always curious about something like that.\n\n**Career advancement:** This is the second time I've went back to school to complete a small certificate just because I feel there's potential for me to leverage that for a better job and advance into more fulfilling work.

The study attributes the deaths to factors including introduced disease, such as smallpox and measles, as well as warfare and societal collapse.\n\nResearchers then calculated how much land indigenous people required and then subsequently fell into disuse, finding that around 55m hectares, an area roughly equivalent to France, became vacant and was reclaimed by carbon dioxide-absorbing vegetation.\n\nThe study sketches out a past where humans were influencing the climate long before the industrial revolution, where the use of fossil fuels for the manufacturing of goods, generation of electricity and transportation has allowed tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere.\n\nWidespread deforestation for agriculture and urban development has also spurred the release of greenhouse gases, causing the planet to warm by around 1C over the past century. Scientists have warned that the world has little over a decade to drastically reduce emissions or face increasingly severe storms, drought, heatwaves, coastal flooding and food insecurity.\n\nThe revegetation of the Americas after European arrival aided declines of global carbon content in the air, dropping by around seven to 10 parts of carbon dioxide for every million molecules of air in the atmosphere. This compares to the 3ppm of carbon dioxide that humanity is currently adding to the atmosphere every year through the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of talk around \u2018negative emissions\u2019 approaching and using tree-planting to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change,\u201d study co-author Chris Brierley told the BBC.\n\n\u201cAnd what we see from this study is the scale of what\u2019s required, because the great dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few parts per million.\n\n\u201cThis is useful; it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate.\u201d",

One of my friends whose dad diagnosed with epilepsy took care of me during the incident, and he said it looked very similar to his dad's seizures. I was spasming, trembling and suddenly went from sleeping to waking up with my eyes wide open and after some time talking about things around me cheerfully, my self-awareness returned when ambulance came, I felt completely normal, there was no any confusion, even I thought my friends are joking at first and, I was able to talk clearly, give information about myself and what had happened from my perspective, and even joke around with my friends as if it were a normal day with my friends.\n\nI've seen two different neurologist and several tests done. I told them about some possible factors that might have contributed to the seizure. like my working schedule in shifts, staying awake for a long time after work, smoking that night and eating a lot of high-carb foods (I don't know it has effect), and when they asked about 'have you ever experienced a strange feeling' I described the strange aura feeling that I wrote in detail below  There are no sign of epilepsy in my 24 hours EEG and MRI results So, my first physician told to me there is no need to be anxious about and that I don't need to take any antiepileptic, It is possible to be a some provoked seizure,  but the second physician with the same test results recommended taking Keppra 500mg. His reasoning was based mainly on the strange aura feeling I described.\n\nthe feeling that I think might be an aura first happened to me about 5 years ago, when I was walking alone suddenly I felt something strange, not exactly anxiety but more like excitement, the main thing was that I felt calm and peacefulness, and kind of dejavu, sometimes when I take a bath I close my eyes and ears to relax and release stress and that same peaceful feeling comes over me and I enjoy it a lot, so the dejavu feeling when I was walking is so similar to that. Maybe I'm making up this connection myself.\n\nI have not been able to sleep properly for the past few days. As you know, my dream of becoming a pilot feels like it\u2019s completely slipping away along with all the effort and investment. But what I'm more worried about is the impact on my life as a whole. should I be worried even though the first physician said so, and could the feeling I described actually be an aura?",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nThank you for you time.  I really respect this community and could use advice and support.  I want to join your ranks!\n\n**My food background**\n\nI (30M) went vegan almost overnight a little over 6 years ago for ethical reasons.  \n\nHowever, despite the reputation that accompanies the label, I have been FAR from the pinnacle of nutrition.  Think Oreos and impossible burgers on white bread buns, not broccoli, sweet potatoes, and salads.\n\n**Where I'm currently at** \n\nI've always wanted to get my nutrition on track at some point down the line.  \n\nI'm 6'0 and a little under 180lbs, and in a perfect would I'd like to get to \\~155lbs, get over my fear of the gym, and then put on some bulk.  That said losing weight is NOT the motivating factor for me.\n\nI don't also don't feel bad on my current diet, even though I'm open to (and hope to!) feel better.  What I really want to do it look out for my future health. \n\nI sought out books on nutrition and have found myself working through *How Not to Die* and have found it incredible persuasive.  \n\nIt really seems I can put more years (and more good years!) into my life by changing my diet to WFPB*.*  Combined with my doctor telling me my LDL cholesterol was \"very mildly elevated,\" I've finally found the motivation to clear out all my processed foods, throw away the canned iced tea, and shopped the rainbow at my grocery store. (Cheapest grocery haul ever!)\n\n**My relationship with food**\n\nI don't really like eating, and I don't think I have since I've become vegan.  \n\nI have absolutely zero regrets about that change--but the only foods I really crave are foods I gave up years ago.  I've never become physically grossed out by meat or learned to love veggies, I've never figured out how to keep down mushrooms, and eating broccoli is a chore (even if it's one I can manage).\n\nThe only exceptions are things like impossible whoppers/candy that makes me feel \"meh\" afterwards, and obviously not worth keeping in my diet.\n\nAll this is actually part of the reason I think I'm ready to make this change.  \n\nIf I already think of eating as a necessary habit rather than a source of enjoyment, why not make that habit as good as it can be?  \n\nSure it's not exactly fun, but if you have to take your medicine--why not take the best medicine available.\n\n**My current struggle**\n\nThis brings me to my early attempts to eat a WFPB diet.\n\nJust a couple days in, and I feel like this a lot more than just taking my medicine.\n\nFor breakfast I had tofu patties rolled in nutritional yeast and a bunch of baby kale on toasted whole grain bread.  I also had a banana and 2 mandarin oranges.\n\nFor lunch I cooked a large sweet potato (for the first time!), seasoned it, and ate that alongside another banana and orange.  No oil!!\n\nThe problem?  I did the math and I'm only at like 800 calories on the day even though I feel like I've been eating all day, I'm also still hungry and can't focus on other things.  I had to wake up in the middle of the night to eat peanut butter on toast to get back to sleep.\n\n**What are my options?**\n\nGiven that I don't enjoy eating, and at best tolerate the foods I need to get down--I'm going to be miserable if I have to spend all day preparing and swallowing foods.  At least with an impossible burger I could eat it and feel full for the afternoon.\n\nI'm ready to take my medicine, but I don't want it to take up my whole day literally or mentally.\n\nI suppose I could eat peanut butter, brown rice, and beans every day, but I don't want to burn out on foods I already don't like.\n\n**Help Please :)**\n\nDespite sounding so negative, I really am excited about the benefits of a WFPB diet and want to join your ranks--but I'm looking for a help finding a way to implement the diet that doesn't leave me hungry or unhappy because I have to eat greens 4 hours a day to get enough calories.\n\nAny advice, perspective or encouragement would be so so helpful*.  Thank you!!*\n\n  \n",

Year-to-date basic $0.41, diluted $0.40.\n- **Adjusted EBITDA**: $13.6M in Q3 2025 vs. $15.4M in Q3 2024. Year-to-date $38.9M (2024 YTD: $43.2M).\n\n**Segment Performance**\n\n- **Gas Cylinders**: Q3 sales $42.9M (flat Y/Y), adjusted EBITA $2.8M (down 24.3%). YTD sales $131.0M, down 4.9%. Margin pressure due to softness in Alternative Fuel cylinders; offset by strong aerospace/SCBA cylinder sales.\n- **Elektron**: Q3 sales $50.0M (up 2.5%), adjusted EBITA $8.4M (down 9.7%). YTD sales $149.5M, up 16.3%; adjusted EBITA $23.4M, down 7.5%.

YTD sales $13.4M, down 39.6%. Net loss on disposal: $1.1M.\n\n**Cash Flow and Financial Position**\n\n- **Operating Cash Flow**: $18.4M year-to-date (YTD 2024: $25.6M).\n- **Investing Activities**: $(0.5)M year-to-date, including $4.3M net proceeds from Graphic Arts sale.\n- **Financing Activities**: $(16.2)M net outflow, including $10.5M in dividends paid and $1.9M in share buybacks.\n- **Cash & Equivalents**: $6.0M at quarter end, plus $2.4M restricted cash (total $8.4M).\n- **Debt**: $43.3M outstanding ($25.0M current), with $19.2M revolving credit facility.

Includes $3.8M in accelerated depreciation.\n- **Disposal Related Costs**: $1.2M YTD ($9.5M in 2024). Includes $1.1M loss on held-for-sale asset group.\n- **Effective Tax Rate**: Elevated at 35.3% YTD (34.2% 2024). Q3 tax provision notably high at 52.8%, impacting net income margin.\n- **Legal/Regulatory**: No material change in risk factors, but indemnifications continue from recent divestitures; one legal settlement concluded, covered by insurance.\n- **Pending Trends/Headwinds**: Ongoing softness in Alternative Fuel cylinder demand, zirconium powders; macroeconomic and geopolitical risks; high working capital (inventory at $95.1M vs. $83.6M prior year end).\n\n**Outlook**\n\n- Management remains focused on cost control, operational efficiency, maintaining liquidity, and selective capital investment for long-term growth.\n- Divestiture of non-core assets (Graphic Arts) complete; further streamlining of business ongoing.\n- No off-balance sheet arrangements (besides disclosed bonding facilities).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLuxfer Holdings experienced stable to slightly growing revenues year-to-date, driven by Elektron, though profitability compressed due to higher restructuring and one-time costs. The balance sheet remains strong with manageable debt, solid liquidity, and continued dividend payments. However, investors should monitor ongoing restructuring, tax rate volatility, and potential softness in end-markets, especially as margin pressures continue.\n\nVisit [Publicview AI](https://www.publicview.ai/chat) to search and analyze millions of SEC filings using AI.",

Because of that, I\u2019ve been using DoorDash for years, but it\u2019s expensive and not helping me reach my goals.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t want to cook at all \u2014 I\u2019m looking for fully prepared meals that I can just microwave or heat up in under 5 minutes. I still want the meals to taste good, keep me full, and help me lose weight without feeling like I\u2019m eating bland diet food.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking into Factor, HelloFresh, and a few others, but I\u2019m not sure which one makes the most sense for my situation.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s tried different services like these, especially while focusing on weight loss and convenience, I\u2019d love to hear what worked best for you.\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\udcaa\n",

Nine-month sales were $1,169.0 million, up 17% from $996.5 million in 2024.\n- **Gross Margin:** $18.8 million in Q3 2025 (5% margin), down from $30.1 million (8% margin) in Q3 2024. Nine-month gross margin was $98.4 million (8%) vs. $61.4 million (6%) prior year.\n- **Operating Loss:** Loss from continuing operations was $(55.4) million in Q3 2025, significantly higher than $(1.2) million in Q3 2024. Nine-month loss from continuing operations was $(49.6) million, little changed from $(48.9) million in 2024.\n- **Net Income/Loss:** Net loss for Q3 2025 was $(53.3) million vs. net income of $5.8 million Q3 2024. YTD net loss stands at $(56.9) million, compared to $(2.8) million for 2024.\n- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Q3 2025 loss per share was $(3.30) vs. $0.35 profit in Q3 2024. Nine-month loss per share was $(3.51) vs. $(0.17) in 2024.\n- **Adjusted EBITDA:** $17.8 million for Q3 2025, down 15% from $20.9 million in Q3 2024. Nine-month Adjusted EBITDA improved sharply to $87.4 million vs. $26.6 million in 2024; margin rose to 7.5%.\n- **Goodwill Impairment:** $48.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in Q3 2025 due to sustained share price and business divestiture, reducing balance sheet goodwill to zero.\n- **Cash Flow:** Cash from operations for the nine months was $7.3 million, a steep drop from $96.5 million in prior year. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2025 were $34.4 million, down from $79.6 million at year end 2024.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity:**\n\n- **Total Assets:** $1,561.4 million at 9/30/2025, down from $1,679.2 million at 12/31/2024.\n- **Total Debt:** $336.1 million at 9/30/2025 (including $273.5 million in fixed rate 2020 notes and $54.0 million ABL revolver).\n- **Stockholders\u2019 Equity:** $783.0 million at 9/30/2025 (down from $854.6 million at YE2024) driven by net losses and goodwill write-off.\n- **Inventory:** Inventory was $283.2 million, up from $258.0 million at year end.\n- **Share Repurchases:** 71,000 shares repurchased in Q3 2025 at an average price of $29.26.\n\n**Segment Information and Trends:**\n\n- **Sales Mix:** Food service sales grew to $182.0 million in Q3 2025 (up from $142.1million), while Folding carton declined to $143.0 million (from $182.1 million).\n- **Volume & Price:** Paperboard shipments increased 3.1% to 324,198 short tons in Q3; average paperboard sales price fell 2.7% to $1,160/short ton.\n- **Cost of Sales:** Up 5% in Q3 driven by increased labor/overhead and supply chain (freight). Cost increases partially offset by cost reductions in raw material and energy inputs. Nine-month cost of sales rose 14.5%.\n\n**Business Update:**\n\n- **Divestitures:** The tissue (consumer products) operation was divested in November 2024; results are now classified as discontinued operations.\n- **Acquisition:** Augusta, Georgia, paperboard facility acquired in May 2024 for $708.2 million; integration and restructuring activities ongoing.\n- **Cost Reduction:** New cost reduction plan implemented in 2025, with $6.1 million in plan-related charges YTD (mainly severance).\n\n**Risks and Uncertainties:**\n\n- **Legal:** Subject to a newly filed environmental lawsuit in Georgia related to PFAS, among other routine litigation.\n- **Operational:** Risks include inability to realize synergies from Augusta acquisition, supply chain/price volatility, labor disruptions (notably at Lewiston, Idaho), and possible further impairments.\n- **Market:** Pricing pressure from competitive capacity, macroeconomic slowdown, and new U.S. tariffs. Customer concentration is a risk.\n- **Debt & Liquidity:** Increased leverage post-Augusta deal; compliance with ABL covenants maintained.\n\n**Outlook:**\n\n- Q4 sales volumes expected to be down due to seasonality and slower retail demand. Labor negotiations and external economic factors (including tariffs and policy changes) pose ongoing uncertainty.\n\n**Investor Considerations:**\n\nClearwater Paper faces ongoing operational challenges including a sizeable goodwill impairment, higher debt, tightening liquidity, continued restructuring/integration costs, and industry headwinds. However, Adjusted EBITDA growth over nine months suggests some operational improvement post-divestiture. Legal and environmental exposures, along with macroeconomic and sector-specific risks, should be closely monitored. The company\u2019s financial capacity remains adequate but under pressure.\n\nVisit [Publicview AI](https://www.publicview.ai/chat) to search and analyze millions of SEC filings using AI.",

But, as far as I'm aware, no evidence whatsoever has been presented to substantiate this idea.\n\nBut the logic gets even worse when one remembers that Sollecito literally had ***knife collection.*** Why would either of them be habitually carrying around a kitchen knife when he had far better \"tools\" for a murder or self defence.\n\nThe Knife also had clear evidence of being used during food preparation - so were they using it to prepare food and then carrying it around in a handbag?\n\nThis may seem like an argument from incredulity - but it certainly seems like an implausible scenario. \n\nAnd then there is the problem of, if it were the murder weapon, why would they have just cleaned it and put it back in the kitchen drawer? If they were trying to cover up the murder surely they would have tried to dispose of it somewhere else?\n\nWhen we factor back in the fact that the knife was not compatible with Meredith's wounds.  \nWhen we factor back in that it had no signs of being used in the murder.  \nWhen we factor back in that it tested negative for blood.  \nWhen we factor back in that starch was found on the blade that would have absorbed the blood (which would have come up in the tests)\n\nThen the idea that this random kitchen knife was the murder weapon becomes, frankly, comedic.\n\nWhich leaves us with the question of Meredith's DNA supposedly being found on the blade. As we know, the forensics team broke international protocol to get that DNA result - and that subsequent analysis produced negative human DNA results from the blade.\n\nSo, where is the real murder weapon? We may never know. Because the investigators failed to do their jobs properly.",

Great location. https://www.airbnb.com/l/wE3y69FY\n\nFood: \nGustos \n\nLa perlita \n\nLas Tapatias - birria tacos\n\nKondesa - fancy\n\nEl Billy - smoked meat \n\nMaple bakehouse - great cafe \n\nAlberto\u2019s - beach bar \n\nMojito factor - bar \n\nMoney bar - drinks\n \nCozumel dreaming - sushi \n\nJeanie\u2019s - breakfast \n\nLos sera\u2019s - pizza \n\nLa choza \n\nSunsets - if you fish, you can bring them fish and they\u2019ll make it a whole meal for $10 a plate \n\nMingos - burgers and smoothies \n\nEl pique - tacos \n\nBlue truck - sandwiches \n\nCoconuts and mango - near playa casitas \n\nBoba - bobu te \n\nDiego\u2019s tacos \n\n\nFavorite beach clubs: \nBuccanos - very chill, calm vibe. Great food. \nPlaya Azul - favorite snorkeling spot \n\n\n\nThings to do: \nCozumel museum \n\nChocolate factory - I think the tour was fun to do one \ntime, they make chocolate for you from scratch \n\nBee sanctuary - very interesting, although a lot of it is teaching about the gods of the island. \n\nPassion island - definitely an adventure, you can take a jeep to colibri and then there\u2019s a guy with a boat who will take you over. \n\nPunta sur \n\nChankanaab \n\nArt gallery \n\nRuins on the north end of the island \n\nWalk around the square \n\nCat cafe \n\nPlanetarium \n\nEl mirador tide pools \n\nDrive around the island \n\nCenote el aerolito\n\n\n\nBoat stuff: \nSnorkeling - we always go with abrimar fishing \n\nFishing - we also go with abrimar (Mario) \n\nEl cielo - again abrimar but el cielo is a must in my opinion. \n\n*I see a lot of recommendations for fishing with Pedro, we personally had a horrible experience with him. He\u2019s basically a booze cruise so if that\u2019s your thing you\u2019d enjoy him.* \n\nDiving - like I said I don\u2019t dive but I know scuba Tony comes highly recommended. \n\n\nWe\u2019ve always rented a scooter but I don\u2019t recommend that to people because they can be extremely dangerous. I\u2019ve personally seen at least one scooter accident a day while I\u2019ve been there. \n\nIf you have any other questions or anything just comment below. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a bunch more I\u2019m just not thinking of right now. \n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "This is something that touches many of us, whether directly or indirectly. These conditions affect millions of people globally, and it\u2019s important for us to understand them\u2014not just to help ourselves, but to support others in our lives who may be struggling.\nAnxiety \nWe\u2019ve all felt nervous or anxious at some point, but anxiety disorders are different. Imagine living with a constant, vague sense of fear or dread, even when there\u2019s no real reason. That\u2019s what people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder go through. They experience ongoing worry and restlessness, making it hard to relax or focus on daily activities. Now, some of you might know someone who has experienced a Panic Attack. This is when anxiety hits suddenly and intensely\u2014shortness of breath, chest pain, and an overwhelming sense of terror. These are not just \u2018moments of stress\u2019\u2014they\u2019re deeply distressing experiences that can leave a person shaken.\nOCD\nAnother common but often misunderstood disorder is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Think about how many times you\u2019ve checked if the door was locked before leaving the house. Now imagine feeling like you must check it repeatedly, even when you know it\u2019s locked. People with OCD often have obsessive thoughts and feel driven to perform certain rituals or routines over and over, even when it disrupts their life.\nIllness Anxiety disorder\nwhere someone is constantly worried that they have\u2014or will develop\u2014a serious illness. This isn\u2019t just being cautious; it\u2019s an overwhelming preoccupation that can consume their thoughts and affect their daily life.\nDepression \nOne of the most commonly recognized mental health issues is Depression. This is more than just feeling down for a day or two. Depression is a condition where a person loses interest in almost everything\u2014they might withdraw from social interactions, struggle to sleep, or even feel that life isn\u2019t worth living. It\u2019s often triggered by personal setbacks, like the end of a relationship or failure to reach an important goal, but it can also appear without any clear cause.\nSuicide\nAnd we can\u2019t talk about depression without mentioning suicide. Sadly, the rates of suicide are rising. If\nSuicide Prevention\nWarning signs:\n\u2022\u2060  \u2060Difficulty concentrating\n\u2022\u2060  \u2060Personality changes\n\u2022\u2060  \u2060Changes in eating, sleep patterns\n\u2022\u2060  \u2060Social withdrawal\n\u2022\u2060  \u2060Substance abuse\nFactors leading to suicide:\n1.\u2060 \u2060Previous attempts\n2.\u2060 \u2060Family, peer, work-life problems\n3.\u2060 \u2060Cultural influences\nWHO measures to reduce suicide:\n1.\u2060 \u2060Care for those who attempted suicide\n2.\u2060 \u2060Limit access to suicide means\n3.\u2060 \u2060Early identification, treatment and prevention\nADHD\na disorder that affects many children: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). If you\u2019re a parent or teacher, you might recognize the signs\u2014kids with ADHD often have trouble focusing on tasks, especially those they find boring, and they\u2019re easily distracted. They may act impulsively or struggle to sit still. It\u2019s more than just being fidgety; ADHD makes it hard for children to succeed in school or social settings.\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). \nChildren with ASD may find it challenging to communicate or engage in social situations, and they might have intense focus on specific interests. It\u2019s important to understand that autism looks different for every individual, but early support can make a significant impact on their lives.\n\nDisruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders\nThese might sound unfamiliar, but you\u2019ve probably seen their effects. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), for example, is where a child shows extreme stubbornness or hostility that\u2019s out of proportion for their age. Meanwhile, Conduct Disorder involves aggressive behaviors\u2014bullying, verbal and physical aggression, or even harming others. These are serious issues that often require both family and professional intervention.\n\n Eating Disorders\nAnorexia Nervosa is where a person sees themselves as overweight even when they\u2019re dangerously underweight. They may starve themselves or exercise excessively. \nBulimia Nervosa, where someone eats large amounts of food and then purges, either by vomiting or using laxatives, to get rid of the calories. \nBinge Eating Disorder involves episodes of out-of-control eating, without the purging, which can lead to serious health consequences. These disorders often stem from deep emotional struggles with body image and self-worth.\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\nThis includes alcoholism. \nWe might think that having a few drinks to cope with stress is normal, but when someone becomes dependent on alcohol or other substances, it can quickly spiral into an addiction. Alcoholism affects not just the individual, but their relationships, their job, and their overall health. Withdrawal can cause severe psychological and physical problems, and it requires professional help to overcome\n\npsychological disorders are complex and deeply personal struggles. They affect people in ways we might not always see, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore them. By understanding these conditions, we can create a more compassionate and supportive environment. \nMental health matters \nLet's:\n1.\u2060 \u2060Break the stigma\n2.\u2060 \u2060Educate ourselves\n3.\u2060 \u2060Support those affected\n4.\u2060 \u2060Seek professional help",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,   \n  \nQuick Summary  (Link to my 1st Check-in Post Below):  \n   \nDiagnosis : keratoacanthoma-type cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (in other words, skin cancer on the temple area near left eye).\n\n50 years old, male, switzerland Height 1m75, 105kg initially (BMI 32.7)\n\nAttempt : 30 Days Hydric Fast\n\nPost #1 - Day 4 Post : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1og195a/30\\_days\\_water\\_fast\\_to\\_love\\_my\\_soul\\_through\\_cancer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1og195a/30_days_water_fast_to_love_my_soul_through_cancer/)  \n  \n**I am now at the end of DAY 7 (1 hour in from Full 7 days)**\n\nYesterday was intense, I was travelling and working from 5am to 9.30pm, full day teaching photography  & Creative mindset. Travelled by train (common in switzerland) it was super cold, and super interesting to find myself in train stations filled with bakeries, smell of croissants, chocolate buns, and in the evening sushis, poke bowls, and stuff i could really enjoy eating. Airports / Train stations are the Hell of Fasters \ud83d\ude02 yet was a great test and a good moment, and felt good after that day.\n\nI am in a moment in my life where I wanted to move to the Canaries Islands (go back there to live), and my relation to work, to where I live these days, how my social life is taking place etc. as well as this cancer siding with me for now, So many emotions, reflections, thoughts going through my head.\n\n**Mental vibe:** Today, felt more grounded, good clarity, letting the unknown unfold, open for me, and let myself be open to the magic of what comes along. Nice conversations with family & friends online, and more in a space of allowing and surrendering.   \n  \n**Fun Story:** i went to get some D3 Vitamin drops (i live in the mountains in switzerland, little sun, Vit D helps for skin cancer too), and my eye was drawn to a panel \"it's time to change jobs\" so I had to laugh about signs & synchronicities. \n\n**Actions taken:** Been suddenly struck with a need to sort out old clothes, Essential Oils, my home pharmacy, and going for some initial Clearout on the aspects of External reality... letting stuff go, making space for the new... more minimalist, more place to feel, live, move, touch, be present. \n\n**Good news:** Finally received my Potassium Citrate powder, so I'm adding this which i could not for the first 6 days of my Fast  \n  \n**Hunger vibe :** I can feel the hunger, now and then, not globally hungry, the body grumbles in the belly occasionally, I noticed the hunger feeling was when I was lacking sodium, so i just take some salt in ma palm and lick it off... i enjoy that better than drinking water with sodium.   \n  \nI tend to be a bit of a masochist it seems, as I do enjoy looking at recipes ideas, and suddenly was like... how do we make Keto Lemon Curd?  How complex is making a Vietnamese Pho? A cheese Fondue would be nice... So I feel there are not \"cravings\" but I do feel food in a positive way is in my life, even without accessing it... I can talk about the food, enjoy imagining it, feel like ohhh that's sooo good... and still feel love deeply inside for my process and the whole fasting i'm going for. \n\nHow would I enjoy the refeeding and post-refeeding to look like in terms of my new way of feeding myself, based on what I like as type of food, cultural food, and also looking into it being more healthy too. \n\n**Emotional Process:** Been doing quite a bit of inner work (still not quite enough, yet i'm allowing my process to take part without spanking myself for it). Hypnosis sessions, energy healing sessions, and will be integrating EFT the next days (all tools i'm professionally trained in) and I feel it's really helping me on the process of connecting to my inner truth and the quest for connection i'm in too.\n\n**Physical Vibe:**  The back is pulling a bit (happens to me sometimes) so I'm feeling it's releasing some stuff too, as it wasn't pulling 2 days ago, it comes and goes, and when I relax into it, feel it, surrender, breathe into it... the tension goes away. Mouth taste is a bit \"thick\". Stools still flushing a bit. Urines are still clear yellow...   \n  \nOverall feeling quite good and just amazed at my body and my mindset is till going strong. \n\n**Weight :** Not really looking into the weight, as it's not the factor for me, and depending on where i place the scales at home i don't get the same weight. However today I was thinking... i'd like to get back closer to my 80-82 kilos, So this brought the reflection on Refeeding above, and the future maybe Rolling Fasts with OMAD on break days for a few months after this ends.\n\n**Hydratation & Electrolytes:** \n\n* Water + 1 coffee spoon of salt\n* Roiboos, Chamomile tea, Green tea\n* Vitamin D - 3000ug (drops) \n* Potassium Citrate (Finally arrived, started today) - 640mg\n* Magnesium Glycinate : 480mg \n\nAm considering adding a Vitamin Complex (set of a-z vitamins) but unsure for now. \n\n**Final words:**   \n  \nI'll set aside the few haters, as when we do something good, we polarize and will make people angry, i'm not a pack of rice, and can move and give them love too, they also deeply need a hug. \n\nThanks for reading, for the awesome and kind vibes on my previous post, the amazing support, the kind words, and the inspiration on ideas to explore... And looking forward to telling you more in another post for around Day 10. \n\n\n\n",

Access to their care is essential for people with lung conditions who need ongoing treatment. But new research from GoodRx shows that more than 5.6 million Americans live in \u201cpulmonology deserts.\u201d These are areas where people must drive at least 1 hour to see a lung specialist.\n\nThe researchers identified 506 counties across the country with limited or no access to pulmonologists. Many of these counties are in rural areas of the central and western U.S., including North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana, and Nevada. In some of these places, people must travel over 4 hours for care.\n\nThe shortage stems from broader health care challenges in rural regions, where fewer doctors practice and hospitals are sparse. As respiratory conditions remain a national health priority, closing the pulmonology care gap is needed to improve lung health and prevent complications.\n\n[**Factors that Drive Unplanned Asthma-Related Emergency Department Visits Across the U.S.**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675725006059)Asthma leads to nearly 1 million emergency department (ED) visits each year in the United States. A recent study looked at what might cause some people to visit the ED for asthma more often. Researchers looked at records from 47,227 people with asthma between 2018 and 2024. They found that nearly 30% of people with asthma had at least 1 ED visit for asthma, and 1 in 5 (20%) had multiple visits.\n\nPeople with lower incomes, Black people with asthma, and people with conditions such as chest pain, infections, or anxiety were more likely to have frequent ED visits. Living near abandoned buildings or in areas perceived as unsafe also increased risk. On the other hand, having higher income, health insurance, older age, and being male were linked to fewer emergency visits.\n\nThese findings highlight how social and neighborhood factors \u2013 not just medical ones \u2013 can affect asthma outcomes. This shows the need for targeted strategies to improve care and reduce asthma-related emergencies.\n\n[**Men and Women\u2019s Immune Systems Respond Differently in Asthma**](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1165/rcmb.2024-0565OC)Asthma affects males and females differently throughout life. In childhood, boys are more likely to have asthma. But as adults, women are more likely to have asthma and more severe symptoms. To understand why, researchers studied how gene activity differs between men and women with asthma.\n\nUsing data from more than 3,600 adults, the researchers found 61 genes that showed different activity levels between men and women with asthma. These genes are linked to how the immune system reacts to allergens and inflammation in the lungs. The study also found that gene activity patterns in children with asthma are not the same as those in adults.\n\nOverall, the results show that sex and age affect how asthma develops and how the immune system responds. This may help researchers find new ways to personalize asthma treatment for men, women, and children in the future.  \n\n\n# Chronic Hives\n\n[**FDA Approves 1st Oral Targeted Treatment for Chronic Hives**](https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-receives-fda-approval-rhapsido-remibrutinib-only-oral-targeted-btki-treatment-chronic-spontaneous-urticaria-csu)  \nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also called chronic hives, causes recurring hives that last 6 weeks or longer without a clear cause. Many people with CSU continue to have symptoms even when taking antihistamines, which can affect sleep, work, and emotional well-being.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved Rhapsido\u00ae (remibrutinib). It is a new pill for adults with CSU whose symptoms continue even after taking antihistamines. Rhapsido is the first pill in a new class of medicines called BTK inhibitors (BTKi) and works by blocking the release of histamine and other chemicals that cause itching and hives.\n\nUnlike injectable treatments, Rhapsido is taken 2 times a day and does not require lab monitoring. In clinical trials, people taking Rhapsido had less itching and fewer hives within just 2 weeks. About 1 in 3 participants became symptom-free after 3 months. Common side effects included mild cold symptoms, headache, and nausea.\n\nThis approval gives people living with CSU a convenient new option that may help improve daily life and provide faster relief from symptoms, especially for people whose CSU may not be controlled by antihistamines alone.  \nEczema\n\n[**FDA Expands Approval of Opzelura\u00ae Cream for Children Ages 2 to 11 with Eczema**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250918551027/en/Incyte-Announces-Additional-FDA-Approval-of-Opzelura-Ruxolitinib-Cream-in-Children-Ages-2-11-with-Atopic-Dermatitis)  \nEczema can cause red, itchy, and irritated skin that affects sleep, comfort, and confidence. Many caregivers struggle to find treatments that work safely for their children.\n\nThe FDA recently expanded its approval of Opzelura\u00ae (ruxolitinib) cream for children ages 2 to 11 with mild to moderate eczema. This makes Opzelura the first treatment of its kind available for younger children whose eczema is not well-controlled with other prescription creams.\n\nIn clinical studies, more children using Opzelura achieved clear or almost clear skin after 2 months than those using a non-medicated cream. The cream is applied directly to the skin, is easy to use, and has a well-understood safety profile, with mild side effects like a runny nose or minor infections.\n\nOpzelura was first approved for use in people aged 12 years and older in 2021. This extended approval gives families a much-needed, new option to manage eczema symptoms in children without using steroids. The treatment can be used short-term or as needed, offering hope for better relief and quality of life for children living with this chronic skin condition.",

Investors are reminded of risks typical to the gaming industry, including litigation, regulatory changes, and economic sensitivity.\n- **Interest Rate/Market Risk:** No debt outstanding and substantial cash on hand limits current exposure to rate risk.\n\n**Other Notable Points**\n- **Tax Rate:** Effective tax rate for the nine months was 21.3%, down from 22.3% the prior year.\n- **Accounting:** No significant changes in accounting policies or adoption of new policies materially affecting the results.\n\n**Investor Takeaways**\nMonarch continues to demonstrate solid topline growth, profit expansion, and strong cash flow. The Company\u2019s debt-free position (with $107.6M in cash) and continued dividends/repurchases reflect robust balance sheet strength. However, the large construction litigation liability remains a significant watch point. Ongoing capex supports property quality and guest experience, which underpins future performance.\n\nVisit [Publicview AI](https://www.publicview.ai/chat) to search and analyze millions of SEC filings using AI.",

Just a useless AI chatbot that kept me trapped in a fruitless loop. A few days later a rep finally emailed me, not to fix anything, but to say they could not stop the next shipment and would refund me five dollars for the spoiled ingredients. \n\nI did not sign up for this service to argue over pocket change. I wanted healthy, easy plant-based meals. What I got was rotten trash in absurd amounts of plastic packaging.\n\nSave yourself the headache and avoid this service like the plague.\n\n",

      "title": "So what service is everybody switching to?",
      "selftext": "I see the official consensus on here is that BA service as a whole has completely tanked ever since the recent rebrand. I\u2019ve been a customer since 2020 and it used to be very unusual to have any problems other than an occasional ingredient substitution or more rarely something that came spoiled. Now, there is some kind of significant issue every single week\u2014 meals entirely missing or incorrect, spoiled food, important ingredients replaced with something completely different (pomegranate syrup replaced with VEGETABLE CONCENTRATE\u2026..) without so much as an explanatory email, and once a box was just skipped entirely without any notice for the first time in 5 years\u2026 of course I report these things every time, but in the past I\u2019d get a response right away, and now it takes several days before I get a partial refund! Like many (or all?) of you, I also got a physical letter in the mail with a coupon code for 50% off the next 2 boxes as a sort of apology for these repeated fuckups, which I guess was effective in terms of making me say \u201cokay I won\u2019t cancel for a couple of weeks,\u201d so I loaded up those boxes with extra stuff so I could get more bang for my buck, and then half of that stuff didn\u2019t even show up\u2026 so I get more credits on my account every week, and the cycle continues \ud83d\ude2d. (Plus, there seem to be more of the same meal options available every week\u2026) \n\nAll of this seems to point to a business that is dying anyway\u2026 I mean handing out 50% off coupons to make up for bad service and then doing nothing to change that service\u2026 it smacks of desperation. I feel like they\u2019ll shutter within a year at this rate. \n\nMeanwhile, I want to use a service like this to meal prep on weekends because I just started a 9-5 office job with a commute. So for me, quick, healthy and nutritious meals (or specifically things geared towards meal prep) would be a priority. (And of course, deliveries that are on time, fresh, and consist of the things that I actually ordered\u2026 but that *should* be a given.) I don\u2019t know much about any other meal kits so I\u2019m kind of lost when it comes to choice here. I tried Hello Fresh for a trial run back in 2020 and my perception was that the meals seemed a bit unhealthy (probably colored by the fact that they were sending random candy bars as freebies lol) but this could be inaccurate/ things could have changed since then.  \n\ntl;dr **If you\u2019re leaving Blue Apron for a different meal kit service, which one are you choosing and why?** Any prior experience you\u2019ve had with these services would be appreciated\u2014 although as we all know, it\u2019s not necessarily applicable to the present, as these things can easily go to shit.
