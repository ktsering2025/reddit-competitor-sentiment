I just want to say that I feel bad for people that blindly follow some of these recipes for the first time that contain pepper flakes and trust hello fresh enough to EVER put the entire pack of red pepper flakes. I literally never use the whole pack of pepper flakes or seasoning in general. For this recipe i literally used barely any, only used a pinch and tossed out the rest and it was still a tad too spicy for us, imagine if I\u2019d put in the whole packet! \ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\n\n",

      "selftext": "I've been subscribed to HelloFresh for over 2 years now, I originally subscribed when they offered the free add-on item for life with any active subscription. Loved all the fresh and delicious meals I've cooked over the years. \n\nLast Christmas, I was gifted a voucher for one free box from a family member (as an aside, it didn't even cover the full box price, only $80 but whatever). I finally redeemed it two weeks ago, and last week I received an email saying my subscription had been cancelled. I immediately logged in and re-activated the subscription, and confirmed there was an active card on file still. My assumption is their system tried redeeming the gift card a second time, saw zero balance, and cancelled the account... But honestly I am unsure how this happened. Their support team offered no answers. I also noticed I no longer get the free add-on item with my weekly box and so I called customer service to report this issue.\n\nAfter multiple calls with their customer service, their best solution for me was offering me 40% off for one box, stating that they no longer offer the free item for life voucher and as such cannot re-activate it on my account. \n\nI am writing this post after a half hour long frustrating call with them where I cancelled my subscription and will be looking elsewhere since they refused to honor their own mistake. \n\nIf you plan on redeeming any sort of gift voucher code, please double check your account the following week or share the same situation I find myself in.",

      "selftext": "Meals You Love is a meal planning app that creates weekly meal plans tailored to your tastes and dietary preferences. It integrates with Kroger and Instacart's APIs so you can add your meal plan groceries directly to your cart. You can also import your own recipes to include alongside AI suggestions.\n\nI originally built this to help my wife with meal planning and grocery shopping. We were always struggling to decide what to make and inevitably forgot ingredients. Most meal planners felt too rigid or generic, and few handled the grocery side well (or at all). We've also used meal kits like Home Chef in the past but they end up being quite expensive and produce a comical amount of packaging waste, plus you still wind up needing to purchase groceries anyway. In all honesty, I also wanted an excuse to try building something \"real\" using AI and to see if it could be used in an actually useful manner.\n\nIt's a paid service but there's a 1-month free trial. Would love any feedback!\n\nTech stack:\n\n* Cloud Run\n\n* Firestore\n\n* Vertex AI / Gemini\n\n[https://mealsyoulove.com](https://mealsyoulove.com)",

      "selftext": "Exploring the Benefits of Prefab Barndominium Homes: Affordable Designs for Modern Living\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrefab barndominium homes have gained popularity among those looking for affordable yet stylish living spaces. These unique structures blend the charm of a barn with modern home designs, providing an attractive option for various lifestyles. If you're considering a new home, exploring these options could unveil a path to affordable and efficient living.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of prefab barndominium homes is their cost-effectiveness. Traditional homes often involve extensive costs for materials and labor. In contrast, prefab homes are produced in factories, leading to lower costs due to economies of scale. This significant saving allows you to invest in unique features, upgrades, or simply stick to your budget. You can achieve your dream home without breaking the bank.\n\nAnother element that elevates prefab barndominiums is their versatility in design. Since these homes are customizable, you can choose a layout, size, and features that suit your specific needs. Whether you envision a cozy space for one or a spacious home for a family, you can tweak the design accordingly. This flexibility makes it easier to create a living environment that resonates with your lifestyle.\n\nAdditionally, many prefab barndominium homes focus on sustainability. The materials used in these structures can often be eco-friendly and energy-efficient. When selecting a prefab design, pay attention to options for insulation, energy-efficient windows, and renewable energy sources. By prioritizing sustainable features, you can reduce your carbon footprint while enjoying the benefits of modern living.\n\nAdopting a barndominium lifestyle also means embracing open floor plans. These designs often incorporate large living spaces that promote a sense of community and togetherness. An open layout allows for fluid movement throughout the home, making it perfect for family gatherings or entertaining friends. You can arrange your furniture to create different zones while keeping the entire space feeling airy and roomy.\n\n- **Cost-effective construction:** Reduce overall expenses with factory-built homes.\n- **Customizable designs:** Tailor your home to meet personal preferences and needs.\n- **Sustainability:** Choose eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient features.\n- **Open floor plans:** Enjoy spacious living areas that enhance social interactions.\n\nMaintenance is another crucial consideration when it comes to prefab barndominiums. Typically built with durable materials, these homes require less upkeep than traditional residences. Steel framing and metal siding are common features that withstand weather conditions and pests, ultimately saving you time and money on repairs. This endurance can be particularly appealing for busy families or those who prefer low-maintenance living.\n\nThe construction timeline for prefab homes is significantly shorter than traditional builds. Since these structures are built in factories, they can be assembled quickly on your site. This aspect is especially advantageous for those looking to minimize the disruption to their lives or families during the building process. A streamlined construction schedule means you can move into your new home sooner than expected.\n\nWhile exploring affordable designs for modern living, consider the location of your barndominium. Many homeowners love the idea of living in rural areas while still enjoying modern comforts. A barndominium can provide that unique blend of rural charm and contemporary design. Not only does it allow for more significant property possibilities, but it also gives you a chance to enjoy nature while getting the most out of your living space.\n\nIn recent years, the trend of living in mobile or modular homes has surged, adding even more appeal to the concept of barndominiums. With the right design, you can create a mobile barndominium, giving you the freedom to change your surroundings without sacrificing comfort or quality. This makes it possible to travel or relocate while enjoying the home you love.\n\nExploring prefab barndominium homes opens your eyes to a world of possibilities. With their affordability, modern designs, and versatile features, these homes provide the perfect solution for contemporary living. So, if you're ready for a new beginning or simply looking to downsize, consider whether a barndominium may be the right fit for you. This unique housing solution blends functionality with style, making it an enticing choice for anyone looking for affordable designs.\n\nCustomization Options in Prefab Barndominium Homes to Fit Your Lifestyle\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrefab barndominium homes are rapidly becoming a popular choice for those seeking affordable and versatile living spaces. One of the standout features of these modern masterpieces is their impressive customization options, allowing you to create a home that fits your lifestyle perfectly. Whether you're looking for a cozy retreat or a functional family hub, the possibilities are nearly endless.\n\nWhen it comes to customizing your barndominium, the first major decision is the layout. You can choose an open concept design that maximizes space and fosters social interactions. Or, if privacy is a priority, consider a more segmented layout that provides distinct areas for living, working, and entertaining. This flexibility ensures that you can tailor the home\u2019s design to your specific needs.\n\nAnother significant aspect to consider is the exterior finish. The aesthetic appeal of your home starts from the outside, and with prefab barndominiums, you can select from various materials and colors to match your vision. Popular options include:\n\n- Metal siding \u2013 known for its durability and modern look\n- Wooden accents \u2013 for a more rustic or traditional feel\n- Vinyl siding \u2013 offers low maintenance and a variety of color choices\n\nDon't forget about the roof! You can opt for different styles like gable, flat, or even a skillion roof, each contributing uniquely to the overall look of your barndominium home. Roof materials also vary, which can affect both the aesthetics and energy efficiency of your house.\n\nInterior customization is where the real fun begins. Think about your lifestyle: do you need a large open kitchen to entertain friends? Or perhaps you dream of a cozy reading nook? The interior layout can be configured with your ideal spaces in mind. Key features to consider include:\n\n- **Kitchen design:** Choose between a chef\u2019s kitchen with an island or a compact culinary space with all necessities.\n- **Bathroom arrangements:** Spa-like bathrooms with soaking tubs or functional powder rooms for guests.\n- **Bedrooms:** Additional bedrooms for children or guests, or perhaps a home office space.\n\nLighting is another crucial element. With customizable windows and skylights, you can flood your spaces with natural light. Whether you prefer large, panoramic windows or more compact designs, the right choice will enhance both the ambiance and energy efficiency of your prefab barndominium home.\n\nRemember, storage options play a vital role in crafting a practical living space. You can incorporate built-in shelving, custom closets, or even attic storage to keep everything organized. These thoughtful touches can make your everyday life more manageable and enjoyable.\n\nMany companies that offer prefab barndominium homes also provide sustainable options. If eco-friendliness is important to you, consider energy-efficient windows, solar panels, and high-quality insulation. Making choices that reduce your environmental impact while saving on energy bills is a win-win!\n\nAs you explore your customization options, don't forget about outdoor spaces. Patios, porches, or decks can extend your living area and provide a great place for relaxation or entertaining. Adding features like outdoor kitchens or fire pits can elevate your lifestyle and make your barndominium a social hub for family and friends.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to choose a builder who understands your vision. Many offer expert advice on customization, helping you navigate every step of the process. This collaboration ensures that your prefab barndominium home accurately reflects your personal style and meets your functional needs.\n\nThe customization options in prefab barndominium homes are vast. The ability to design a living space tailored to your lifestyle not only enhances comfort but also contributes to satisfaction with your home investment. Whether you prioritize layout, materials, colors, or sustainable solutions, the choice is yours. With a little creativity and the right builder by your side, your dream barndominium is within reach.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPrefab barndominium homes offer an exciting blend of affordability and modern design, making them a compelling choice for anyone looking to build their dream home. The cost-effectiveness of prefab barndominiums allows you to invest in a stylish and functional space without breaking the bank. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer or looking to downsize, these homes provide an attractive solution tailored to your budget.\n\nCustomization is key when it comes to prefab barndominiums. With various designs, layouts, and finishes available, you can create a space that perfectly suits your lifestyle. Imagine choosing everything from the exterior color to the layout of your living spaces. This level of personalization ensures your new home isn't just a structure but a representation of who you are and how you want to live.\n\nThe advantages of prefab barndominium homes extend beyond aesthetics and personalization. Their durable construction and energy-efficient features contribute to lower utility bills and a reduced carbon footprint. You can take pride in owning a home that not only meets your needs but also promotes sustainable living.\n\nChoosing a prefab barndominium is more than just selecting an affordable design; it's about embracing a lifestyle that values efficiency and individuality. As you explore options, consider how this unique housing solution can enhance your everyday life. With the right design choices, you can create a warm, inviting space that reflects your personal tastes while keeping your budget in check.

      "selftext": "I have been wanting to redo this and move it over to the /u/brewsplorer account for quite some time. With so much change, I figured a new take was worthwhile.\n\nLAST UPDATE: October 27, 2025\n\n\\##Stats on Nashville Beer##\n\n24 breweries, 2 Cideries, and 1 meadery  \n21 are local, all Tennessee  \n32 taprooms (only 1 taproom serves as taproom for 2 brewing companies: Blackstone)  \nBreweries with multiple locations: \n\n* **Living Waters** \\- 2 Locations\n   * **East Nashville** (Trinity Lane)\n   * **West Nashville (**The Nations)\n* **Southern Grist** \\- soon to be Xul, 2 locations\n* **Tailgate** \\- 8 + *Airport* \n\n# Breweries\n\nLocal breweries and their taprooms in **bold**. Emojis for food \ud83c\udf55\ud83e\udd6a\ud83c\udf54\ud83e\udebd\ud83c\udf5f\ud83e\udd57 and Dog \ud83d\udc15 (generally outdoor only) & very family friendly\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\u200d\ud83e\uddd2. Realize all breweries are family-friendly, so these are just the ones that seem to go above and beyond or are more restaurant than brewery.\n\n1. **Barrique Brewing & Blanding** (founded 2017, took over current space in 2021) is located downtown on the East Bank, a few blocks from Nissan Stadium. It was started by Joel Stickrod in a warehouse. When Little Harpeth was purchased by Lipman, Joel acquired their brewer Spencer Longhurst. In the beer geek circle, these two are considered to be the best brewers in Nashville. Styles: Known mostly for lagers and wild & mixed-ferm sours, including barrel aged lagers, they were able to expand their clean program a few years back when they acquired Little Harpeth's 20 barrel fermentation tanks. Barrique is one of a few that routinely does cask beer. No flagships to speak of; very experimental, but also heavy on traditional lagers you might not find in many breweries around the country. No food on site. \ud83d\udc15\n2. **Bassline** \ud83c\udf55\ud83e\udd6a\ud83c\udf54\ud83e\udebd\ud83c\udf5f\ud83e\udd57(founded as Bold Patriot in 2019, rebranded in 2023): Bassline is located in the *L&L Market* on Charlotte in West Nashville. The original recipes are from *Bold Patriot Brewing*, which formerly occupied this space. The brewery is more of a taproom and live music venue these days. They do BOGO beer specials Tuesday - Friday. Beer styles are across the board, with no standouts. Cafe inside. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\n3. **Bearded Iris:** Shortly, this entry will become *Wiseacre*, as they purchased Bearded Iris summer 2025 and are converting the taprooms. Bearded Iris is known for Homestyle, the number one selling craft beer in Tennessee, and likely the main reason Wiseacre acquired Bearded Iris. Various styles, but not sure which will persist once Germantown is completely taken over by Wiseacre. They are renovating to add a kitchen. Normal brews on tap include Homestyle, Tunnel Vision, Wave Craze, Pink Flamingo, and Pep Talk lager. \ud83d\udc15\n4. **Black Abbey** (founded 2008): is located in South Nashville in the 100 Oaks area (Sidco Drive). They have been traditionally known for their Belgian style beers, but the brewery rebranded a bit, as the beer styles are more varied today. Minimal food on site but often have food trucks. Regular releases are Original Lager, Pub Ale, Tennessee IPA, Five Points IPA, The Rose (Blonde Belgian), and the Special (Belgian Dubbel). Another brewery that routinely has beer on cask. \ud83d\udc15\n5. **Blackstone** (founded in 1994, moved to North Nashville in 2001). Kent Taylor and his partner Stephanie Wines started this brewery in 1994 on West End. Kent was about the beer, Stephanie about the food. Stephanie passed in 2014 and the Brewpub was closed on West End and move to the brewery in 2016. Beers are more traditional, with the staples being Hopjack IPA, Atom Bomb Double IPA, Tropjack (a tropical version of hopjack), St Charles Porter, Nut Borwn Ale, and Chaser Kolsch. Their annual Black Belle (barrel aged in Belle Meade Bourbon casks) is a crowd favorite when unveiled each year on Black Friday. The building also serves as the taproom for **Nashville Beer Company** (see later). No food currently, but you are free to bring something in. Half price brews on Sunday.\ud83d\udc15\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\n6. **Broadcast Brewing** \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf5f(founded 2011, reopened in South Nashville in 2023): Broadcast is the brainchild of Mike Causy, who is often the only person working in the brewery. It is a small operation that would be easy to miss if you did not know where to look. Currently, he has 3 of his brews on tap, with guest taps to round out the list. Has a permanent food truck - *Austin's Burgers* \\- in front for food. Current style list are a dark red, dark IPA, honey blonde ale, and a vanilla cream ale.\ud83d\udc15\n7. **Crazy Gnome** \ud83c\udf55\ud83e\udebd(founded 2020, current location 2025): Crazy Gnome is helmed by Grayson Miller, the main brewer.

When they run a Kolsch service, it is a lot of fun. THis brewery was founded by three people, Ryan McCay (brewer), Thomas Becker (musician) and Gentry Wiggington (coffee expert).

Monday Night (Atlanta Brewery - opened in Germantown in 2021): One of the neatest brewery space in Nashville, this is part of the former Neuhoff factory building.

Carl Mueller, now of *Stokehaus*, brewed for *TennFold* until 2025. Current brewer is *Sean Cassidy*, who brewed with *Bearded Iris*, before the buyout from *Wiseacre*. TennFold, like East Nashville Beer Works, tends to brew a bit drier. Core beers are Business Hippie West Coast IPA, Flat Pedal Golden Ale, Irma Gersch German Style Pils, Feast With Friends American Style Lageer, and Groovy Shade IPA. \ud83d\udc15\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\n23. **Yazoo** \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf5f (Opened 2003 in Marathon Village, moved to the Gulch in 2010, then to Madison in 2019):  One of my first experiences in the local brew scene was joining a friend to help Yazoo bottle beer. We were paid in beer, of course. *Yazoo* was part of our brewery row, others of which include *Jackalope* (around the corner), *Tennessee Brew Works* (only one still in original location), and *Czann's* (now defunct). Yazoo was founded by Linus and Lila Hall. Brandon Jones is responsible for their funk beers (Head Funkmaster. They have Grillshack Burgers as their permanent food popup. \ud83d\udc15\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\n24. Yee-Haw (2019 - Downtown: SoBro): This brewery combined with *Ole Smokey Moonshine*. While the HQ is out of Nashville, unlike *Monday Night*, they brew in their location. Downtown, it attracts a large amount of visitors. The brewery was started in Johnson City, TN in 2015. They have locations in  Knoxville, and Greenville, SC, as well. \n\n# Cideries\n\n1. **Diskin's Cider** (opened 2018)**-** last day was Sunday, October 26, 2025 at their OG location. They have stated plans to reopen in the future, but have not outlined a location. Started by Adam Diskin and Todd Evans, the cidery specializes more in sweeter ciders. My favorite of the bunch is BTC (Bourbon Tart Cherry), which is seasonal, but has been seen regularly in recent years. Others include Bob's Your Uncle, Lil' Blondie, Tiki Tonik, and Babe Magnet.  \n2. **Cyanide Cider** (founded 2025) - Another creation of Grayson Miller, *Crazy Gnome*. Where Diskin's is more about sweet cider, Cyanide focuses on drier ciders. Grayson has also created various mixes to create cider cocktails and won the Common John Brewery of the year award for his apple pie sour. They have food on site. \n\n# Meadery\n\n1. **Honeytree** \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf5f (founded in 2019): This meadery does a variety of traditional and experimental meads. They harvest their own honey, so the mead supports local beekeepers. There is a *Bad Luck Burger* food truck on the premises for food.\n\n# Breweries only in Distribution\n\n1. **Harding House** \\- Nate Underwood.

Now *V Italian Restaurant*. \n8. **Mayday Brewing** (Murfreesboro: 2012 - 2024)\n9. **Panther Creek** (Murfreesboro: XXXX - 2024 - still in distribution) - The hobbit themed Green Dragon Inn, pub and taproom, failed in this same location. \n10. **Czann's** (Downtown: 2013 - 2019; Nations: 2020 - 2025)\n11. **Bearded Iris, Sylvan Supply** (Taproom closed this summer).

      "selftext": "[https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-october-27th-2025](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-october-27th-2025)\n\nIssues that will be resolved in our November 4th update, in order of most voted by Simmers:\n\nTop 5 Most Voted Fixes:\n\n* Identified and resolved some cases of photos turning black in inventory when taken with the camera. Applies to new saves only.\n* Sabotage interaction is no longer available on objects without completing Deviance aspiration.\n* When the Mixologist is in conversation with NPCs, they'll break out of it if a drink order is queued up and be more responsive.\n* Children should now more clearly inherit some features from their parents. There may still be some variation (a child's nose may be slightly wider than their parent's, for example, but you should be able to see distinct features passed down between generations; if both parents have large ears, the child probably will too.\n* Relationship decay after having a baby was too fast and was destroying relationships. It has been slowed.\n\n**Base Game Fixes:**\n\n* \u2018Sit Up' Milestone now properly unlocks and displays after travelling.\n* Sims won't use their phone when in the water or jogging.\n* \"Take Vacation Day\" is only given to the sim if their next shift is within the next 24 hours. This means that some careers often have 1-3 days free so sims must wait until the last day in order to request that Vacation day. When the option is not available it is now greyed out with a tooltip explaining it's only available 24hrs before the next shift.\n* Sim put books, foods and drinks into their intended inventories (bookshelf, fridge respectively) instead of more random inventories like the ICYA Chest/Sticker storage box.\n* Random Sims will no longer enter the home without knocking when using sliding doors.\n* Aspirations no longer default to the first one when looking at or switching to another.\n* Fixed issue where infants were being placed near a crib or playmat instead of remaining in it if the player travels to a different lot with a Sim and returns.\n* Excessive 'Wants' are no longer generated from music when there are other categories of preferences.\n* Mischief interactions between Sims who both like mischief can now properly succeed. This was happening only with Get Famous installed and that has now been fixed.\n* \"Dance to stereo music\" wants are now fulfilled when Sims dance using earbuds.\n* Sim will no longer autonomously perform 'Grab a Drink' interaction with 'Tea Magic Personal Brewer'.\n* Resolved an Exception that triggered while putting the baby in the crib leading to Infant resetting and laying on the floor outside of crib.\n* Infants can now acquire the Little Babbler trait.\n* \"Energized\" interactions will appear for Energized Sims on all showers; including locker room showers.\n* Fixing CAS applied makeup color swatch selection to be consistent on swapping items with the one that is highlighted. Tattoos are still being worked on to provide the same functionality.\n* Toddlers with 4 or 5 Movement Skill will no longer walk as if they have lower Movement Skill while in certain moods.\n* Sims will stop wearing hats while in their nude outfit.\n* When Sim goes to work, all the newborn/infant/toddler will be sent to daycare. Adoption events and pregnancy events were blocking this and now be resolved.\n* Nannies and Butlers will perform their duties more often and regularly. They will check if they need to perform duties every 30 minutes instead of every 4 hours.\n* Fire Fighters can fit into unroutable errors to better fight fires.\n* Soulmate is now added when the friendship/romantic track is full. The bug was caused when the friendship value was not updated in the romance relationship and assigned the wrong relationship bit. In existing saves, Sim now can be soulmates if they lower their friendship/romantic value and raise it again to achieve the soulmate status.\n* Aspiration goals will no longer reset when Sim travels to another lot, you switch to another Sim at home, and then perform \"Bring Here\" interaction on the first Sim.\n* Excessive Townies will no longer generate every time the computer is used. We adjusted a filter for style influencers that was generating new sims if you had not met a style influencer.\n* Moodlets related to fear will not trigger after the Fear of Dark trait is removed.\n* Fixed cases where NPC sims wear random weather outfits which they don't own.\n* Trash from all inside trash cans will now be emptied and dumped to the outdoor trash can.\n* Maid Sim with neat trait will no longer get stuck in grill cleaning loop.\n* \\[CAS categories (excluding tattoos & pets) will again show all content from their subcategories. A previous update was made to the CAS Menu to support the new tattoo arcs. The change also caught several other categories, causing them to only show one subcategory at a time unlike their usual behavior of showing all categories at once.\n* \u2018Listen to <genre specific> Music' wants are now fulfilled when Sim listens to music through Earbuds.\n* Sims can only Woohoo in steam rooms that are indoors and not broken. They will stop unsuccessfully attempting outdoors.\n* Trash will be present in the world and on Community lots and trashcans can be properly rummaged.\n* Sim's needs should now gain more consistently while they are low at Work/School while you're playing on a different lot.\n* [Bug Archive] \"Complete an aspiration with the Child Sim\" goal now completes properly in 'Aliens Stole my Parents' Scenario.\n\n**Affecting Multiple Packs**\n\n* Added glass wall pattern styles for Greenhouse Haven Kit and Life & Death glass roofs.\n* Patients and Ranch Hands will no longer arrive in random hats.\n* Reduced the size of the footprints of the following Radios (stereoTable): The Grimophone, GrammyFone Old-Fashioned Music Player, Kitty Tunes Radio, HiFive High Fidelity Radio, Life's a Ball Speaker, Vintique Record Player.\n* Nannies/Gardners/Ranch Hand will no longer return immediately after dismissing or firing them.\n* Cafeteria workers will now show up as expected.\n* Cafeteria workers will not leave as soon as the game loads from save.\n\n# Expansion Packs\n\n**Adventure Awaits**\n\n* Adding curtain rod for modular curtains in Adventure Awaits pack.\n* Skills from Adventure Awaits can no longer be increased in University \"Sit in on Skill Class\" interaction without the pack installed.\n* Firewatch tower structure pillars in the Wander Woods Wilds will no longer disappear when zooming out using sims 3 camera.\n* Child Sim's Legs will no longer show a wrinkled texture when wearing \"cfBottom\\_EP20FlutterSkirt\".\n* Fixes to Getaway Outfit selection on Controller: Scheduler UI should display correctly after setting Custom Role's outfit multiple times and Game should remain responsive.\n* Getaway Sims will keep performing activities and interactions when running in 3x speed\n* Fixing an issue where Sims were teleporting and exiting the pool after performing Woohoo in Water.\n* Camera shake will time properly with the Geyser blow.\n* Drowning, meteorite, lightning, cowplant or freezing deaths will now occur during Getaways.\n* \"Examine\" interaction will not route fails if butterflies are placed in one of the center slots of Butterfly & Moth habitat.\n* Can now gift a Friendship Bracelet to Imaginary Friends.\n\n**Enchanted By Nature**\n\n* When the \"Limit Fairies to Innisgreen\" option is enabled, Fairy Sims should not autonomously appear in their fairy form in any world outside of Innisgreen.\n* Most Fairy eye colors are now available for Infant, Toddler or child sims. 10 of the 18 overall Fairy eyes are now allowed.\n* \"Connect to Power Grid\" interaction is now available on lightning root when the plant has bloomed.\n* If Sims is on cooldown from a cured ailment, pixies won't be able to immediately add it back.\n\n**Business & Hobbies**\n\n* Sims will no longer reset and trigger a Last Exception when performing grab food interactions after using Secret Spice perk.\n* Customer Sims more consistently complete their laundry tasks before leaving the lot.\n* Sticky Fingers Aspiration: A Sim with an owned business can now swipe properly at Mischief level 10.\n\n**Life & Death**\n\n* \"Return to office\" interaction is now available on the Reaper when on assignments in Reaper career.\n* Random NPC Sim will no longer replace Edith.\n* Fixed cases when Funeral Guests would wear random outfits or work outfits (whichever they had last worn) to the Funeral event when no outfit was selected. Sims should now wear more appropriate outfits.\n* \"Death by Pufferfish\", \"Death by Overheating\" & \"Death by Freezing\" death types are now available for child Sim in CAS.\n* Woohoo with Grim will no longer get cancelled. This is happening because of an incompatibility with grimReaper\\_CarryScythe.\n* Ghost Essence notification now fires properly and players will only see the TNS if essence is actually being added (and no essence is already in inventory).\n* [Bug Archive] Fixed cases where NPC Waylon and NPC Lady Ravendancer were being selected for the 'Walkby' Situation and pulled from their duties.\n* [Bug Archive] All grave and urn options should appear now under 'Display as' interaction on urn/tombstone.\n\n**Lovestruck**\n\n* Preventing Neighborhood Stories romance actions from happening between incompatible Sims. Previously, it was not taking Sim's Romantic Preferences into account with \"Romance Changes\". This now verifies that Sims are still romantically interested in each other's genders before considering the action to be successful.\n\n**For Rent**\n\n* Rent in bills section will no longer show 0 and Tenants will now be able to pay rent.\n* Changing a Penthouse lot type to Residential Rental will not result in white screen asserts or an infinite loading screen.\n* Tenant agreement 'Remaining lease' duration will no longer revert and freeze when Sim travels somewhere and then returns to home lot.\n* The Kettle & Pressure Cooker will not cause excessive cases of \"Unpleasant Surroundings\" moodlet and Sims' reactions to smelly food. The pressure cooker now won't automatically decay into the spoiled state, but instead will only start decaying after anything is prepared there, and will reset after the object is emptied or cleaned out.\n* Tenant revolt event will not trigger when Rental Unit Events are disabled in game options.\n* Now able to convert Residential Rental lot to Residential lot when active sim not living in the main unit of the Residential Rental.\n* Tenants on Residential Rentals can send items on Plopsy/Trendi.\n* Aspiration goal \"Handle a Maintenance event\" now ticks off after completing the goal.\n* Resolved issues where Property Owners would fail to inspect or repair broken objects.\n* The \"Garden Blight\" event of Maintenance Troubles Lot Challenge will now progress as intended.\n* Stoves and Ovens can be replaced during the explosive malfunction event on a Non-Residential Rental.\n\n**Horse Ranch**\n\n* Sims will not receive Fizzy buffs from drinking crafted Nectar drinks.\n* Ranch Hand will no longer stay past 7pm.\n* Mini goats and sheep will no longer be able to use the gate when it is locked.\n\n**Growing Together**\n\n* Sim will no longer stand idle when a child asks for help with bike riding indoors.\n* Sims will no longer receive random milestone moodlets without achieving the milestone.\n* Daycare milestone will now unlock for toddler & infant Sims away from the lot when they return.\n* Child Sim will not be forced to sit on the edge of the pool when 'pull out loose tooth' or 'wiggle loose tooth' interaction is performed.\n* Child Sim's Confidence no longer stuck on Neutral and will change as expected.\n* Winning the marble game will now add new marbles to the child Sim's inventory.\n* Temporary Stay Guests will now sleep; even in sleeping bags.\n\n**Cottage Living**\n\n* Added message to help players understand that Gnomes have a reason for dropping gifts outside of holidays after Agatha Crumplebottom interacts with them.\n* Egg will no longer spoil while incubating it to hatch.\n\n**Snowy Escape**\n\n* Sim no longer gets a bored moodlet from an outdoorsy lifestyle for being inside when they are actually outside.\n\n**High School Years**\n\n* A high school official will always be present to give out the diplomas to graduating students.\n* Teens graduating early will no longer get 'Resentful About No Prom Invite' Sentiment when the Sim attends or skips the Prom.

      "selftext": "I see the official consensus on here is that BA service as a whole has completely tanked ever since the recent rebrand. I\u2019ve been a customer since 2020 and it used to be very unusual to have any problems other than an occasional ingredient substitution or more rarely something that came spoiled. Now, there is some kind of significant issue every single week\u2014 meals entirely missing or incorrect, spoiled food, important ingredients replaced with something completely different (pomegranate syrup replaced with VEGETABLE CONCENTRATE\u2026..) without so much as an explanatory email, and once a box was just skipped entirely without any notice for the first time in 5 years\u2026 of course I report these things every time, but in the past I\u2019d get a response right away, and now it takes several days before I get a partial refund! Like many (or all?) of you, I also got a physical letter in the mail with a coupon code for 50% off the next 2 boxes as a sort of apology for these repeated fuckups, which I guess was effective in terms of making me say \u201cokay I won\u2019t cancel for a couple of weeks,\u201d so I loaded up those boxes with extra stuff so I could get more bang for my buck, and then half of that stuff didn\u2019t even show up\u2026 so I get more credits on my account every week, and the cycle continues \ud83d\ude2d. (Plus, there seem to be more of the same meal options available every week\u2026) \n\nAll of this seems to point to a business that is dying anyway\u2026 I mean handing out 50% off coupons to make up for bad service and then doing nothing to change that service\u2026 it smacks of desperation. I feel like they\u2019ll shutter within a year at this rate. \n\nMeanwhile, I want to use a service like this to meal prep on weekends because I just started a 9-5 office job with a commute. So for me, quick, healthy and nutritious meals (or specifically things geared towards meal prep) would be a priority. (And of course, deliveries that are on time, fresh, and consist of the things that I actually ordered\u2026 but that *should* be a given.) I don\u2019t know much about any other meal kits so I\u2019m kind of lost when it comes to choice here. I tried Hello Fresh for a trial run back in 2020 and my perception was that the meals seemed a bit unhealthy (probably colored by the fact that they were sending random candy bars as freebies lol) but this could be inaccurate/ things could have changed since then.  \n\ntl;dr **If you\u2019re leaving Blue Apron for a different meal kit service, which one are you choosing and why?** Any prior experience you\u2019ve had with these services would be appreciated\u2014 although as we all know, it\u2019s not necessarily applicable to the present, as these things can easily go to shit.

I don\u2019t hate the new cards, but I did like the older ones better. Maybe it was because I was more familiar with them. \n\nBut THEN\u2026 the app update. It is just horrible. I hate the layout, but what really gets me the most is you used to be able to see like 10 weeks of recipes in advance. After many failed attempts of logging in the app, despite getting auto shipments, I finally did. And when I did, there were only about maybe four weeks showing in advance. I usually get most of them, but not all of them. Well, now today I got another unexpected blue apron. I go in to check the app thinking \u2018OK so I missed a week to skip?\u2019 It called for another update. Once in, I go to skip more weeks in advance and there\u2019s only one week showing now.\n\nSo now I skipped next week, which is the only week showing, and called to ask about recent unauthorized up charges in auto shipments, and also to ask about the app not showing any weeks in advance. I guess they\u2019re working on it? But next, I ask if they can pause me like I had before and they said that is not an option. There used to be some option, but I guess it\u2019s no longer there now. ",
