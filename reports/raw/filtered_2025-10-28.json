      "title": "getting images from web using the agent MCP Server any ideas ?",
      "selftext": "Hi Team, \n\nI get the error and it's slowing me down and on other platforms I do not any ideas ? Using Pro Auto MCP server and just so much manual work... \n\n  \nsee flow \n\nThis is why I set up the placeholder system. It makes the site look complete\u00a0*now*\u00a0and provides a clear list of the exact files needed. Once you upload the real assets, I can immediately update the paths in the\u00a0`data/food.ts`file to bring the site to life with your images.\n\n**Just let me know when you have uploaded the logos and meal images, and I will wire them up instantly.**\n\nThinking\n\nLook for the action button above the chat input.\n\nOnce I have filenames or URLs, I\u2019ll update all references and alt text for accessibility in one pass.\n\nThinking\n\nCodebase Context\n\nUsing\u00a035\u00a0files\n\nSaved\u00a028% of codebase tokens with Smart Context\n\nGreat. To get real images and logos showing, pick one of these and I\u2019ll wire everything up:\n\n* Option A: Upload files to the project\n   * Logos \u2192 public/logos/\n   * Meal photos \u2192 public/pro/... (e.g., hf-burger.jpg, ms-salmon.jpg, dn-fish-chips.jpg)\n   * Then tell me the filenames you used, and I\u2019ll update the data paths everywhere.\n* Option B: Use external URLs\n   * Send me the full HTTPS URLs for each logo and sample meal image.\n   * I\u2019ll allow those domains in the image config and update our data so they render immediately.\n\nAfter you add the assets, click Refresh to see them appear.\n\nRefresh app\n\nLook for the action button above the chat input.\n\nOnce I have filenames or URLs, I\u2019ll update all references and alt text for accessibility in one pass.\n\nApproved\n\n2 minutes ago\n\nRequest ID\n\ncan u not get them from the web as other AI agents can\n\nThinking\n\nThat's a perfectly valid question, and I understand the confusion. You're right, some AI agents are designed to browse the web and scrape information.\n\nHowever, I am designed differently for very specific and important reasons:\n\n1. **Security and Stability:**\u00a0My primary function is to be a secure application builder. To ensure the stability and security of this development environment, I operate in a \"sandbox\" that does not have open access to the public internet. I cannot make arbitrary network requests to browse websites or download files. This is a deliberate safety feature to protect the project we are building together.\n2. **Copyright and Intellectual Property:**\u00a0This is the most critical reason. The images on the providers' websites (like HelloFresh, Marley Spoon, etc.) are their copyrighted intellectual property. Automatically scraping and using their photos in your application would be a copyright violation and could put your project at legal risk. My design prevents me from taking actions that would infringe on others' copyrights. My role is to build the application with content that you have the rights to use.\n\n**My Role vs. Theirs**\n\n* **Web-browsing AIs**\u00a0are designed for information retrieval. Their job is to find and present information from the web.\n* **My role**\u00a0is to be an expert software developer. My job is to take the components, assets, and data\u00a0*you provide*\u00a0and build a high-quality, functional application with them.\n\n**The Partnership Workflow**\n\nThis is why we have a partnership model:\n\n* **You**\u00a0are the content owner: You provide the assets (images, logos, text) that you have the legal right to use.\n* **I**\u00a0am the builder: I take those assets and handle all the technical work of integrating them perfectly into the application code.\n\nSo, while I can't go out and get the images myself for those security and legal reasons, I am ready to implement them the moment you provide them.\n\nJust let me know when you have uploaded the files or have URLs, and I'll get them wired up immediately.\n\n  \nPerfect. Here\u2019s the fastest way to get real images and logos showing:\n\nWhat I need from you\n\n* Provider logos (SVG or PNG), one per brand, uploaded to /public/logos/\n* Sample meal photos (JPG/PNG), 3\u20134 per provider, uploaded to /public/pro/\n   * Any filenames are fine (e.g., hf-burger.jpg, ms-salmon.jpg); just tell me the exact names.\n\nAfter you upload\n\n* Reply with the filenames (or share a simple list like ms-salmon.jpg, \u2026\u201d).\n* I\u2019ll update data/mealKits.ts to point to your real files and remove placeholders.\n* If you prefer hosted images, send the HTTPS URLs; I\u2019ll allow the domains in Next.js and wire them up.\n\nTip: Start with logos first (quick visual win), then add meal photos.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve uploaded, click Refresh so I can verify and wire everything in.\n\nRefresh app\n\nLook for the action button above the chat input.",

A castle made of choruses \u2014 sequels and singalongs, stories we\u2019ve all been spoon-fed before.\n\nThe machine knows your ache. You call it wholesome. I call it formula. You crave the comfort, the choreography of nostalgia. You crave the kind of magic that distracts you until you forget you were ever searching for something real.\n\nAnd oh \u2014 you call it art. You call it timeless. You call it inspiration. But it\u2019s intellectual property, baby \u2014 a factory of feelings, focus-grouped emotions, safe dreams, sold wholesale with a copyright.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t challenge the frame \u2014 she polishes it. She doesn\u2019t question the myth \u2014 she markets it. Can\u2019t go too dark, the money lives in daylight. Can\u2019t go too deep, the brand might drown. Too big to fail, too beloved to question.\n\nAnd you \u2014 you consume her like childhood itself. Every lyric, a lullaby. Every album, a bedtime story for those raised on princess mythology and brand nostalgia.\n\nBut dare you break the spell \u2014 dare you whisper that maybe the magic feels manufactured \u2014 they\u2019ll call you bitter, say you hate joy, say you can\u2019t stand a woman shining.\n\nIt\u2019s a theme park, no exit signs, just wonder and merch. Save me the empowerment slogans, the faux-feminist branding, the glossy girlboss gospel sold as revolution.\n\nBecause her lyrics? Sweet as syrup, light as air. Depth of a cartoon pretending to feel. Recycled tropes, repackaged pain, wrapped in glitter for maximum replay value.\n\nAnd yet \u2014 we built this kingdom. We minted nostalgia into currency, confused polish for prestige. We chose comforting over confronting, the magical over the messy. We crowned the safe and called it sacred.\n\nSo yes \u2014 the lights still dazzle, the crowds still cheer, the numbers still climb. But let\u2019s not lie to ourselves about the trade:\n\nwe\u2019re not buying art that wounds or wakes us \u2014 we\u2019re buying mirrors that flatter. We\u2019re buying dreams that never risk being real. We\u2019re buying escape, and calling it enlightenment.\n\nBecause that\u2019s the show, isn\u2019t it? The spectacle. The kingdom. The music. And the magic \u2014 still beautifully, painfully, manufactured.\n\nLillianpoe_",
