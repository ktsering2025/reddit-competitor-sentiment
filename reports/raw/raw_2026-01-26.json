I skipped my next delivery due this Saturday,  I was looking at my options for the following week and it shows 4 servings still. Is it easier to create a new account with the different preferences?

I love the mushroom Risotto this is a good as the 5 star Italian restaurants. The chicken Milanese is my second fav so far. Most of the time I do the port taquitos or the chicken and Couscous since it low calorie. The chicken green pepper sandos are really tasty and easy to make.

      "selftext": "I know there's lots of buzz about using ML (machine learning, not to be confused with AI) for auto selecting recipes for each week, but I'm gonna be honest with you: First thing I do is go in and unselect all of them. Because, well, they're probably not the best. And if I'm going to spend an hour cooking these meals, I'm gonna spend the extra few minutes making sure I'm cooking something I prefer. \n\nYeah, let's also accept - there's probably a better profit margin on the stuff you auto-select, I get it. Go capitalism. I shudder to think if a slide repeated across internal decks celebrates this.\n\nAnyways, I'm just not a meatloaf person. But that Kung Pao chicken looked great and maybe I couldn't fit it into this week, but I want it to be highlighted for selection the next time it's available. \n\nSo maybe I'm feeling motivated this week to look through your 50 recipes and I see 10 or so of them I actually would like to eat. Let me give you that data. (I actually do this: add them all to my cart on a shortlist, then go and whittle that down to just three for the week). \n\nNext week, I'm probably not gonna have that time or energy to look through all of the recipes. So it feels a little bit like a miss for me to login and see meatloaf auto-selected again, you know? \n\nI'm not exactly asking to swipe left and right on each recipe, but, you know, it would be nice to be able to favorite, or queue, or \"save for later\" certain meals (or even recipes I find online) and when I come back on next week for meal selection, you can do something like push available meals I've expressed interest in previously to the top of my list for that week? \n\nMight be a bit easier than a machine learning algorithm, what do I know? And well, if your techbro CEO still needs to tout advanced machine learning as a core pillar of the technology platform, you can just tell him that \"data is gold\" and then point to the fact that users use your platform for an average of 10 minutes a pop and all you can derive from that is 3 (germane) data points. \n\nJust something to consider.

Taking up to an hour then not counting clean up and there is no dishwasher in this house. \n\nI'm currently living with Grandma and uncle.  just between looking out for them, taking care of this house and cleaning up messes they make. I'm looking for something less time consuming. With plans to maybe make this more of a 7 day out of week thing that I can also get lunch out of it to use for work.\n\nI do have some diet restriction mainly MY GI told me Low Fermentation Diet due to SIBO and just found out about dairy allergy. I always knew I had some kind of intolerance and kept my dairy to moderate or very moderate. Also I due try to keep thing with sodium in check, I have borderline high cholesterol\n\nWould something like gobble be good? I was looking at home chef too as they have ready bake meals, fast and fresh and even express meals. I've even seen things like sun basket, marley spoon. \n\nI'm even considering ready meals that I can use for lunch and dinner. I plan to post over there as well. \n\n\n\n",

Tbh I've tried simplycook/hellofresh etc and I never loved the taste. I liked some and hated some, plus they felt like more effort than I'd have liked. \n\nI am from an Indian background, i am totally in awe of how authentic Cumin Club meals taste. I recommended it to a couple of my British colleagues and they loved it too. I'm not really sure how the technology work, but you literally simply add water and it tastes like it would in a restaurant in India. Everything I've tried so far tastes authentic and great (except the Paneer Bhurji which was a bit bland) \n\nMy favorites so far are Paneer Tikka Masala, Methi Matar Malai and Pav Bhaji. I have tried about half of their recipes so far. They cost \u00a34 per packet if you order 20 together. Shipping is from India so you and it takes about a week to reach you. Their meal kits last for over a year in the shelf. I would suggest trying it, you will be pleasantly surprised. Portions are generous. Hopefully someone somewhere finds this useful! ",

I\u2019m looking for a refund\n\nThey say they can refund me $9 instead of the full price of $65 (first and last time ordering)\n\nI said that\u2019s not what I want\u2026. I asked if it arrives tomorrow and the food isn\u2019t cold do I get a refund?\n\nThey said it\u2019s not their policy as it\u2019s not their fault.\n\nOther posts I see they refund if box is broken. Any thoughts on this?",

My email of 9:30 am this morning said to expect delivery Saturday.  My guess is they were trying to avoid being stuck in a storm in New Jersey tomorrow.  \n\nBad news, 2 dented cans of cannellini beans.  They quickly agreed to give me a  $5 credit, though I really don't want to go out again, as it's getting very cold.  Fortunately Target will deliver beans by 4 pm.  \n\nNow I'm looking forward to white bean soup, and bean enchiladas.  I hope everyone stays warm and safe, and gets their food on time!",

They\u2019re well trimmed, not monstrously huge. But then the chicken breast pieces are just mangled. There\u2019s a lot of fatty or otherwise unappealing pieces, and I find myself spending more time trimming/prepping the pre-cut chicken option than if they just gave us whole chicken breasts that I then had to dice myself. \n\nAnyone else notice this or feel the same way? Or am I just overly picky with my chicken? ",
