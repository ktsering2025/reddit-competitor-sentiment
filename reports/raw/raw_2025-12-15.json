      "selftext": "I have been using hello fresh 5 meals/week for over a year. I joined for convenience and health reasons, figuring it would be easier to maintain a small calorie deficit or maintaince with preplanned meals and meet my health goals. In no way have I ever been strict about dieting, i lost some weight when starting hello fresh and then plateaued when I started Pilates about 6 months ago. I figured it was just the muscle I was putting on, as I\u2019m 25f around 140lbs. But I got super insecure, because no matter what my stomach was super bloated and swollen most of the time.\n\nI quit hello fresh 3 weeks ago because I got some more free time and missed the flexibility of cooking myself - and all my gut problems disappeared! I am cooking recipes super similar the what I was eating before, but i believe it\u2019s because the sodium has been so greatly reduced from my diet. I really don\u2019t know where the insane sodium counts come from in HF meals (maybe the broth concentrates???) but I don\u2019t think I could ever go back with the difference I feel not all bloated on sodium.\n\nI may be extra sensitive to the nutrient, but I wanted to share just in case anyone else is having similar issues as quitting could be a solution.\n\nEdit for salt info: Most of the lighter recipes have at least 1500 mg sodium per serving, so 3000 mg for the whole dish. I maybe add an additional 1/4 tsp per recipe, which would be about 8 \u201cdashes\u201d, accounting for only 590 mg of sodium total, about 300 mg per serving.  HOWEVER, HelloFresh only calculates nutritional info from what they provide, not considering any butter, salt, and pepper the user adds (even if the recipe tells u to).\n\nThanks!",

      "selftext": "It was a 20 free meals deal, which applies a discount over 9 different meals that is equivalent to 20 free meals. I knew and accepted that. The discount split goes: 50% -> 20% -> 20% -> 15% -> 15% -> 10% -> 10% -> 10% -> 10%. This split, with an average box cost of 77$ (2 meals, 3 boxes a week), therefor an average meal cost of $77/(2\\*3) = $12.83 would mean that the promotion would give me a value of $12.83 \\* 20 = $256.66. However the discount split ($77 multiplied by the sum of the discounts found above) equals $123.2 of value, and then no more discount. How can they get away with this blatant advertisement fraud. I tried calling twice to get a breakdown of the promotional terms of service, and they said they would send it, twice, and never have. Someone please explain because this is a huge promotion scheme it appears. Very disappointing",

      "title": "Seeking HelloFresh Alternative Recommendations",
      "selftext": "After about 3 years of HelloFresh, I've just been starting to have \"grass is greener\" thoughts creeping up on me that maybe there are better options out there. Honestly, I'm fine with HF, I just don't have the time to dissect every other company's website and determine whether they're worth trying.\n\nI like:\n\n* Prepping the food and making the meals - I don't really want pop-into-oven/microwave stuff\n* Mindless meal-picking and -making - each week I pick out the meals, the instructions are straightforward - I'm not wasting time digging around for stuff\n* Value - I don't necessarily need the cheapest options, I want quality worth the price, plus as much consistency and reliability as possible.\n* Mix of repeat and new meal options - I have picky kids, I'm cool with getting Hoisin-glazed pork filet every week, I'm also cool with getting something new, if there are enough picky kid-friendly options\n\nI could use more:\n\n* Simplicity - I don't need some of the things I consider \"extra\" from HF - I don't need to top most of the Asian meals with sesame seeds, most of the seasonings I already have and don't need in little-ass baggies. I don't need to add lemon zest to my rice or couscous.\n* Consistency - maybe 10-20% of my deliveries I have an issue with the ingredients (considering I'm getting 3-5 meals, this is probably a 4-8% problem rate per dinner, maybe not that terrible)\n\nWhat are the alternatives I should be considering? From the few posts I've read I should be thinking about EveryPlate...what else?\n\nThanks.",

      "selftext": "Your blatant use of Al is absolutely appalling to me. The recent article in which you brag about how quickly Al can generate meals for you is disturbing.\n\n\"Three months. That\u2019s how long it used to take HelloFresh, the world\u2019s largest meal kit company, to move a chef\u2019s creation from kitchen to customer. The recipe itself required just a few hours of culinary artistry. The production process that followed \u2014 including editing, photographing, retouching, entering data, and translating cooking steps into foolproof instructions \u2014 consumed the rest of that quarter, and it wasn\u2019t even personalized.\n\nToday, the entire journey takes three hours.\"\n\nThis is SUPPOSED to take 3 months, that's what quality means! That's what the point is! Why are multi-billion dollar companies obsessed with cutting corners? People pay you to give them QUALITY products\u2014not AI SLOP!\n\nNo one wants Scallop-Crusted Cod and Corn Chowder. Are you serious? \"Slice each scallop into three coins, tightly shingle slices onto non-white sides of cod as evenly as possible (to mimic fish scales).\" A human chef, designer, editor, would never.\n\nAl garbage is NOT where I am spending my money. My money should go to human beings\u2014those that craft the recipes, fact check, design, pack the meals\u2014not to your $70 million investment in Al.\n\nDO BETTER.\n\nMoved on to Blue Apron. Thanks for 144 boxes I very much enjoyed. Your service made me fall in love with cooking, establish real skills, and gain confidence in the kitchen. Sad it had to end. I hope you all can salvage the business model that you started with. \"We believe everyone deserves honest, delicious food.\" Nothing about this investment in AI is honest.\n\nI hope the people that still work for your company are treated with respect. I send them courage to weather this storm, and hope that this nonsense AI can be regulated as a tool\u2014not as a human replacement. Humans matter, I wish companies would understand that. This world would be a better place if that could happen.",

The menu says in the Ingredients section, there are 2 units of Instant Yeast and the directions say to whisk the flour, yeast, 2 T sugar and 1 T salt together. I got 4 packets of Instant Yeast, with each packet saying they are 7 grams/1 Tablespoon each. So how many packets of Yeast should I use? All the other ingredients indicate an actual amount (the apples say a unit is 2 apples, which I got). I double checked both the online menu in my week and in the Cookbook and they both agree on the 2 packets of Yeast\n\nThere was a previous question on this dessert from someone who wanted to make it on their own and wanted to know how many packets to get from the store. The consensus regarding what HF gives you ended up being that each HF packet was 7 grams each. So it sounds like they gave me 2 packets too many\n\n  \nAnd just to check given Flourgate on the Meatloaf a la Mom recipe, the recipe calls for 4 cups of flour, which I got. Is that correct? \n\n  \nThanks for any help you can give. I plan to make the dessert on Saturday, so there's time\n\n",

I have been using it for almost 18 months and I do like the familiarity of it. Also, their customer service is great. But they have been reducing their vegetarian options and I find myself having to skip boxes very often.\n\nSo, I am looking to try something different.\n\nMain things I'm looking for:\n\n\\- lots of vegetarian options\n\n\\- good customer service\n\n\\- relatively cost-efficient\n\n\\- an easy transition from Home Chef\n\nAny advice is appreciated!

I'm not talking about the one that's across the street or a different building in my complex, because I understand that my apartment complex has an address that's very similar to the one across the street. Sometimes I have to walk across the street it's not really that big a deal. It sucks, but I deal.\n\nThe box was dropped off and the photo was so close to the box I couldn't even see where it was placed, but in the top left corner there were GPS coordinates. I called Factor customer service and I told them hey here are the coordinates they correspond to this apartment complex go tell the driver that he left it at an apartment complex that's like miles away from me. He made a mistake go make him get it. And they said we can't do that because it's a third-party logistics company so we have no way to contact them once they complete the drop-off.\n\nSo she processed a refund and I'm thinking of myself fuck like I'm really enjoying these meals and they're really helping me with my health and fitness goals and now I'm going to have to go a whole week without these meals and there were 10 in that box so that's like half of my food for the week. \n\nSo I decided on the off chance that it really is in that complex I'm going to go check and see if it's in front of the apartment with the same number as mine but at that complex instead of mine. I drove over there and sure enough that's exactly where it was, they left it at my unit number in the wrong complex which means there's probably somebody in that complex who is also missing their box because they're going to end up leaving it at my complex or something, I don't know, LOL.\n\nBut the point here is that not only did I get a refund but I found the box.

You would think that a company of this size would be better about packaging. it seems like they\u2019re reusing these bags way past the the point of them being effective since the lining inside of the bag looked worn down. factor at least used proper insulation and giant ice blocks in their boxes but I got tired of their food. this is really disappointing. \n\n  \nAnyone have a recommendation for good meal prep services that serve southern california?",
