I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had Sea Bass before, especially Chilean (I had a lot of fish as a kid so I could be forgetting), but for sure I\u2019ve never cooked it before and it was a pretty good meal overall. it was quite filling and in fact a little too much as I had a few potatoes left over I was too full to eat. The Za\u2019atar and Sumac spices seemed not nearly as strong tasting as I was expecting but they added nicely to the meal. I used only a little Feta cheese with the potatoes since I don\u2019t like it very much. I will say I ended up using a \\*lot\\* of bowls for the various ingredients and sauce. Fortunately, cooking wise, I only had to use one baking sheet. The thing that confused me was the instruction to add the fish to the baking sheet skin side down as I didn\u2019t notice any, unless it meant the side that didn\u2019t have the pistachio coating\n\nPic of my meal:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh5veohuen8g1.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1a83eca0c141e76e5aaa25d4c171bc5994a31f9\n\n",
