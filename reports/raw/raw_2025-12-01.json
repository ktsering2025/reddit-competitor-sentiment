      "selftext": "\\[throwaway account for obvious reasons\\]\n\nWe've been customers for years, but for the third time in the last couple of months our weekly HF box has come with a religious tract in it. You know, those little leaflets telling you the solution to natural disasters and mental health issues is to watch Fox News and make a \"love offering\" to the scamvangelist organization behind the tracts.\n\nWe get enough of this Christian nonsense crammed down our throats by the government, I'll be damned if I'm paying for it to be delivered with my groceries.\n\nThey're always stuck in on top with the recipe cards, not even in the envelope of \"special offers\", so I suspect this is a rogue box packer doing this on their own initiative. I don't know if that's better or worse. Is HF *selling* box space for this kind of crap, or are they merely unable to control what goes into their boxes?  \n",

The community reaction to these posts is usually a lukewarm \u201cyour fault\u201d. If we\u2019re being brutally honest, it is not. \n\nIn defense of these users, this company can only subsist due to borderline predatory practices. They lure you in with a reasonable deal and drop the hammer down next cycle hoping you forget to cancel. They make it so easy to buy into the system but once you want out they make you fight for it tooth and nail. Most users order on their phones and they know this, so they make it impossible to cancel subscriptions on the app. I think you may be able to cancel through browser, but they take no effort to market this. The only concrete way I know how to cancel is through speaking to a representative over the phone. For me personally, I was linked to a foreign call center. I just wanted to cancel and it was a 45 minute ordeal. I almost folded myself! I wonder how much money this company has made off the non-tech savvy elderly or users too frustrated to care. That should not be accepted! \n\n",

      "selftext": "Big part of the sell, especially from watching (self claimed) unsponsored unboxing GIFs, was that each meal is separately bagged. Great, that'll be helpful because we have an autistic picky eater in the house who will be cooked for separately and we can make sure everything is separated, and just grab a bag and go for it. Meals for 3 in bags, the rest for 1 separate. Easy peasy.\n\nExcept it ain't. \n\nAll the veg just lobbed in the box. Several ingredients plopped in loose too including some cheese, sachets of hard cheese, creme fraiche, and other bits. The numbered bags are miniscule and cluster together (for some of the recipes) the various sachets and packets which are meal specific, and that's it. \n\nSo cue up 25 minutes of trying to unbox and sort out by ingredients to each recipe card, finding bigger bags to rebag each bundle of veg, and having to do so by the light of the cooker hood because the autist in the house can't handle the big lights being on after a week at school. Nothing specified on the recipe card how much of each veg is needed for a given recipe, so where there are two recipes using the same veg we've no clue if they're 50/50, or just a bit for one and loads on the other. Other things don't add up. There are 3 snack size blocks of mature cheddar which is supposed to do 3 portions of Mac and peas, AND 3 SpongeBob burgers, but again no clear clue how much is supposed to go on which, or even if we're missing some.\n\nSo we've got a handful of plastic carrier bags, sistema boxes, and a chiller bag for the shopping filling up the fridge to try and lend some sort of order to the meals so we can actually just grab and cook.\n\nOh, and the extra fruit and veg ordered, also all mixed in, so until the app updates and tells us how much of each there is, we won't know if we're using it from the recipes or from the selection box. Great. \n\nFree desserts? Apparently 3 portions per meal for 5 meals logically means 2 dessert pots. Obvious. Why didn't we work that out for ourselves. \n\nFor a supposedly zero stress product it's actually caused way too much already, and factoring that in - for us - there's no way on earth this would represent good value when upped to full price after the promo period ends.

      "selftext": "EDIT: Nevermind.  I'm cancelling.  I just saw the other reddit post saying HF use AI to generate recipes now.  I'm out.  (https://hellofreshgroup.com/en/newsroom/stories/how-ai-enables-faster-more-efficient-delivery-of-hellofreshs-chef-crafted)  \n  \nTL:DR - any recent HF UK users? If so, were your ingredients still all mixed together?\n\nDetails: I've been using HF in the UK for over 5 years.  5 meals per week for 2 people every week almost without fail.  I did it for the convenience.  About a month ago they started chucking all the ingredients together instead of separated by bag (1 per recipe).  The spices were still separated into mini-bags, but everything else was not.\n\nI get their whole \"environmental/sustainability\" thing, but honestly, I used them for convenience, not the environmental impact.  In fact, if you care that much about the environment, you really shouldn't be using any meal delivery service full stop. I've paused them and have been using Mindful Chef instead as they still separate recipes by bag.  My question: any HF UK users recently get a box and is it still the same way, or have they reverted back?  Was hoping maybe it was a trial and customer feedback might convince them to switch back like they did a couple years ago.\n\nPersonally, I feel it more has to do with labour costs more than the environmental thing.   Their cheaper option EveryPlate already did it this way.  Anyway - rant over.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8i0j5ab1l3g1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94321f67139d6b54454c0df94b40f1b15f9885de",

But the the star of the show (tteok) was greatly missed. Still, it was a nice dish to have after traditional Thanksgiving foods the previous day.\n\nI only realized recently that gnocchi was available in a shelf stable package next to the dry pasta (not refrigerated or frozen). Is it possible that tteok is available this way so I can do mail order instead of driving 1.5 hours to find some?",
