      "selftext": "Hi everyone! We\u2019re working on a new feature in the HelloFresh app called The Cookbook, and we\u2019d love for this community to help us beta-test it.\n\n**What is it?** It\u2019s a tool that helps you take control of your recipe planning. You can grab a link from social media, a blog, or anywhere online and the app converts chaotic videos or long posts into a clear step-by-step recipe all stored in one place.\n\n**The best part:** It\u2019s completely free. If you already have a HelloFresh subscription and the app, great! And if you don\u2019t, no subscription is needed. If you\u2019ve ever saved or bookmarked recipes from multiple sources and want to collect your digital inspirations in one place, our[ Cookbook feature](http://hellofresh.com/cookbook) is meant to be that tool for you.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lkcgl5t7hwig1.gif\n\n**Why I\u2019m here:** It\u2019s in beta so it\u2019s not perfect yet and that\u2019s why we need you. We\u2019re looking for people in this community who love food but want to turn inspiration into action.\u00a0\n\n**We\u2019d love your feedback on any and all parts of the feature!**\n\n* Did you feel confident knowing how to use this feature?\n* Was it easy to save your first recipe?\n* Did the step-by-step instructions make sense?\n* What is missing that would make this your go-to recipe tool?\n\n**How to get started:**\n\n1. Download the latest version of the [HelloFresh app](http://hellofresh.com/cookbook).\n2. Go to your favorite social media app and find a video of a recipe you want to try\n3. Tap \"share\" and choose the HelloFresh app from the list of options\u00a0\n4. If you are ready, head to the \"Cookbook\" tab\n5. Drop your \"spicy\" or \"sweet\" feedback in the comments below!\n\nWe\u2019ll be reading every single comment and taking all feedback into consideration. We want this to be a feature that truly helps you plan meals, save inspiration, and make cooking easier every day.\n\n\ud83d\udc9a u/KatieFromHelloFresh",

      "title": "Boxes Not Delivered for 3 Weeks",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m wondering if this is just bad luck or if others are dealing with the same thing. I\u2019ve had multiple HelloFresh boxes recently that were marked as shipped but never actually delivered. Or will say preparing box and never go from there. This has happened to me 3 times now, and each time I\u2019ve had to reach out to support to get it resolved.\n\nWhat\u2019s starting to feel weird is that I\u2019m on a really good promo/discount plan, and part of me is honestly wondering if that has anything to do with it \u2014 like I\u2019m somehow being deprioritized or nudged out without them outright saying it. I don\u2019t have proof of that, obviously, but the repeated missed deliveries are making me side-eye the situation.\n\nI like the service when it works, but paying for boxes that don\u2019t show up (and having to contact support every time) is getting old fast. I\u2019ve also had many boxes from them. Probably a year and a half or more at this point.\n\nHas anyone else experienced ongoing delivery problems lately? Or noticed issues specifically when on a discounted plan?\n\nCurious if this is a wider problem or just me.\n\nEdit: My third week\u2019s box is out for delivery today. Will note if it actually gets delivered. Should have been delivered yesterday but I\u2019ll take it! Lol.",

I loved Hello Fresh, but I hated the missing recipe cards, or sometimes 3 of the same card in one box, all of the junk mail that went to waste every week, and the lack of portions. I'm not a big person and I don't have the biggest appetite, but those portion sizes did not fill me up or keep me from getting hungry in an hour. Hopefully Home Chef works out better for me.

      "selftext": "Hello! This is my first ever when it post so please bear with me.\n\nI have been using Clean Eatz for about a year now. I had an in-store place in my town and they recently closed down. This resorted to me having to go to their online Clean Eatz kitchen website, which I recently discovered was unaffiliated with the actual Clean Eatz location in store. I found that out because I called the Clean Eatz closest to me, (which is now an hour and 1/2 away) and ask them if the one on Shop is real or not (which they told me they didn\u2019t know of) I gambled used it anyways and got my meals. They were amazing. I do want to look around to other places before I continue with Clean Eatz because I\u2019ve been using them for a while. I am scared of doing subscription places and that\u2019s why I found clean Eatz kitchen to be my favorite option because I could choose different things every time and I wouldn\u2019t have to commit to it. I have heard some friends have issues with like HelloFresh and I did see someone earlier talking about your issues with delivery towards an order they had with another place that required a sub subscription. I hear people have issues canceling subscriptions to food places that are automatic charges per month, online, and healthy. I\u2019m trying to lose weight and although I do love Clean Eatz I just wanna look into other options that other people could recommend. I would love to hear what you guys use as a healthier, ready to eat, option. I know people were gonna say \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just go to a store and make it out yourself?\u201d. The truth is I\u2019m a college student and I get burned out by the end of the day not wanting to cook. After this, I resorted to eating unhealthy fast food which has made me gain a lot of weight. Cooking is not something I\u2019m bad at I just don\u2019t always have the time or energy for it. Not only that, but I have an issue with over eating. I also found out the grocery store when you were trying to shop for one person it can be hard since meals are usually spread between multiple people. That makes me want to eat the food out of enjoyment and continue eating it because I don\u2019t wanna waste anything since every dollar counts in my pocket. It\u2019s more of a mental issue with food that I have so that\u2019s why I find ready meals, prepackaged, and proportioned out the best option for me.\n\nAgain, if you know of any other places that won\u2019t be an issue with subscriptions or missing meals, I\u2019m happy to try a place that does require subscription. I just kind of wanna hear everybody\u2019s recommendation on what they have tried and liked. Maybe even we\u2019re able to cancel right away if they had no issues in doing so. Also looking for it to be semi tasty. Clean needs does need extra seasoning to it in my opinion but overall, I find them pretty yummy at the end of the day.",

      "title": "Has anyone else had a recent change in the state their deliveries are being shipped from?",
      "selftext": "The first time this happened I thought though the location it changed to made even less sense but surely their reasoning was due to the recent weather and delays it's been causing. Ive been getting Saturday deliveries for a while now, I live in AR and my boxes have been picked up by FedEx around midnight Friday for some time now out of TX and had yet to have trouble making it to our local hub around 1-4 am Saturday at the latest (cutoff time for making it on the truck for the day is 6am) so always arrived on my scheduled delivery day. I wasn't surprised at all when after the weather my next box shipped from a different location, but what did surprise me was that they changed to shipping it from NJ. Since id been told that hf has a warehouse out of NJ I figured that had to be why but what I'm confused (and tbh extremely frustrated with atp) is that they only moved the ship date back by one day so it gets picked up by on Thursday. \n\nMy first thought was wow crazy that they can get something shipped at midnight on Thurs from NJ all the way to AR by early Saturday morning......well guess what, they absolutely cannot \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude2d The first week my box was picked up midnight Thurs (1/29) NJ it finally was delivered Thurs (2/5) and that was my delivery for the week of Jan 31. My delivery for yesterday (2/7) was again picked up from NJ at midnight Thurs (2/5) and now shows status of \"we're actively working to get you a new delivery date\" and was last scanned last night at 9:30 in MS\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd74. \n\nMy biggest question though is are they planning on continuing to keep shipping my deliveries out of NJ now moving forward or was this just due to the weather like id assumed originally. I would've thought that this weeks would've gone back to coming from TX but now that it didn't im concerned with whether or not i need to go ahead and just give up and cancel my subscription or not and kinda hate to gamble with whether or not itll go back to normal. Has anyone else been experiencing a change like this too? ",

Back in October my wife and I tragically lost our daughter and it has made simple things like trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, going to the grocery store and cooking each night extremely taxing mentally and physically so we thought that having meals delivered to the house we could just put in the microwave would make things a little easier on that front and it did for the first two weeks. After that the last 3 deliveries we have had have been terrible. Each box has had at least 2-3 meals that have had to be thrown away because they were crushed and the plastic cracked and food and liquid spilled into the box covering all of our other meals. The first time it happened I chatted with an agent and they credited us the meals and left it at that but it has now become a common theme with every delivery and it\u2019s extremely disappointing and leaves us or rather me without a planned lunch a couple days a week because I\u2019d rather my wife not have to deal with that right now. Today was different, today my wife was eating one of her meals and found a long piece of plastic that she almost choked on while eating one of her meals. Another report filed with their food safety department. We tried factor because we thought it would make life easier during this extremely difficult time but now I have to file report after report and buy lunch at the grocery store a couple times a week and I know it must sound ridiculous to some but when you barely have energy to get up everyday this is just the cherry on top that makes things even harder. At this point I think we are going to cancel our subscription and I honestly can\u2019t say I would recommend this service to anyone. I\u2019ll be looking to see if there is another service like it.

      "title": "Done with EatClean",
      "selftext": "So we have been getting meal delivery from EatClean since about April of 2025.  It started out pretty good with only the occasional mistake of an incorrect or missing meal which they would quickly credit me for.  The quality of the food was decent too.  Didn't have a lot of fatty sauces like we were getting with Factor and they had multiple categories like Paleo, GLP-1, etc that made it good to follow certain diets.  Fast forward to about November.  They change delivery service from UPS to something else.  I stopped receiving tracking information and meals would arrive days late.  When we had the large snowfall recently, the shipment was supposed to be delayed a day, which I thought was reasonable. Then one day turned into 2, two to 3 and then they couldn't find my order.  Strike 1.  The next week, with no weather delays the meals are agin delayed by two days.  I call to complain and assure me they are handling the situation and this should not happen again.  Strike two.  This past week, they give me 8 of the 10 meals I ordered.  This time I ask not for a credit, but a refund since I did not receive what I paid for.  They took 24 hours to get back to me and told me they can only do a credit.  Strike three.  I told them to keep it and enjoy the 20 something dollars they refused to refund me and now will lose out on the $500/ month I was spending.  Again, meals were decent, but the constant chasing them down with issues was just getting old.  We're going to try a few other services to see what fits us best.",

I just so happen to read the entire description of Factor\u2019s Smoky Gouda Macaroni & Shredded Beef bowl and found out that there are pecans in it. If you\u2019re not aware, pecans are a tree nut, which ARE NOT posed in the allergen section of the meal\u2019s description. Had I not read that and eaten it, I would have been sent to the hospital or worse. That is completely unacceptable. \n\nWhen contacting Factor and asking if there really are pecans in the meal, the lady I spoke to couldn\u2019t even confirm or tell me the truth. I could hardly even understand her as she clearly was not a native English speaker. I asked her if the allergens would be updated and she said the team would look into it, so if you have tree nut allergies and buy from them, steer clear of this meal! ",

Today's box contained the following items above 40 degrees Fahrenheit:\n\n* 1 Beef Empanadas - 60 degrees\n* 2 Tofu - 47 degrees\n* 3. Mushrooms - 48 degrees\n* 4 Green Beans - 44 degrees\n* 5 Butter - 55 degrees\n* 6 Broccoli - 44 degrees\n* 7 Cheese - 49 degrees\n* 8 Gnocchi - 55 degrees\n* 9 Cream Sauce - 53 degrees\n* 10 Artichokes - 50 degrees\n\nI have read others talk about the ice blocks (plural) in their boxes, but last two boxes have had a single ice block at the bottom only. Most of the warm items were at the top of the box, farthest from the ice block. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm not going to risk food poisoning for convenience.",
