My experience is that I get a much lower rebate when I self report vs. calling and actually speaking with someone.  I've mentioned this before, but today seemed to really reinforce my perception. When I self report, I usually get a credit of a few dollars. It seems I get double or more when I call.   Today just exemplified this.  I was missing 2 items from a meal..  chicken stock (which I have some on hand) and Creme Fraiche.  I started to self report, but had problems with the app, so I called. I was pollite, no yelling or ranting. The agent gave me a credit of $21.98. . Yeah I won't be self reporting anymore. I actually feel a little guilty getting this much credit, because  I can still make the meal, it just won't be as good.",

      "selftext": "I've seen that in the last few months, Hello Fresh users in America are noticing tons of AI generated images for new recipes, along with the recipes themselves being untested, AI generated slop. I'm not sure if I'm late to notice but it's obvious that they're now at least using AI to create their images in the UK (huge five pronged forks with square spoons, rubbery looking food and so on). I also made a new recipe last night that had some parts that didn't really make sense (plus every recipe seems to involve almonds and peanuts sprinkled on top now?!) and I think it's a safe assumption that we're now getting AI recipes here too.\n\nSo I'm going to cancel, like loads of other people seem to be. The quality has really dropped off anyway in the last 6 months or so (ingredients barely fresh on arrival, constant missing or incorrect ingredients etc.). So if now the ingredients aren't worth it and the recipes are crap that you could just generate yourself, why spend the money?\n\nIt's such a shame, it was a game changer for me and taught me a lot about cooking when I started it over 2 years ago, and I recommended it to everyone. Now I'd recommend cancelling before the service gets even worse.",

      "selftext": "I used to receive HF not long after pandemic, then skipped maybe 2 years, saw advertising claiming improvements had been made and re enlisted. My issues have been: being sent meals for 2 instead of (my plan) which is for 3 people, and even when correct, which is most of the time to their credit, recipes are skimpy like really, not ample or off balance, like tonight's salmon banh mi\u200b Sandwiches, we will have salmon for days but 2 tiny packets of chili sauce and the slaw were not enough to accompany the meat and really serve 3 ppl adequately, nor the 2 mini english cucumbers, one extremely miniscule. Try to shrug it off, it is convenient, however, receive alot of wilted produce or goes bad so fast if I dont use right away in day or 2 following receiving. Still, try not to be overly critical for what it is. So yesterday wasnt seeing delivery notice w/tracking, then HF sends message stating apologize but delivery will be a day late. Does anyone know why this is occurring? Between all the issues stacking up and i have seen some questionable billing where credits not received, charged the upcharge for custom/premium meals when I am \\*positive\\* I selected only regularly included meals within the plan pricing, the billing is split up strangely so confusing, its almost impossible to follow along the paper trail of misc fees, but im afraid im about to admit defeat and \u200bbe done with it. Too frustrating. My other selected meal this week, the 2 roma tomatoes sent are in bad shape, and the pkg pf chicken wings the vacuum seal is busted, may or may not be a problem/spoiled or not fresh, but quality has actually REALLY went way down. However: I did appreciate the Ryze coffee samples as a bonus. ",

      "title": "Weird Experience Ordering Frozen Add-On",
      "selftext": "I did the empanada add-on for my Factor meals last week, for my weekly meal order that was supposed to arrive Monday. I know they arrive separately from the Factor meals, they told me that on the website several times and in the e-mails. I got a FedEx notification on Monday evening that my Factor meals (so I thought) were supposed to be delivered Wednesday, which would almost certainly mean they would be ruined since they only use 1 ice pack now, but no actual shipping e-mail from Factor. I did get an email though about my empanadas shipping, and once again reminded that they would be shipped separately. I haven't ordered frozen before so wasn't sure when they would get here exactly.\n\nToday I got my Factor box and to my surprise it was actually only the empanadas. I realized that my actual Factor meals never shipped, that the FedEx email was actually about the empanadas. I've been very busy this week and didn't have time to try to line everything up. I contacted customer service and they told me that my meals were marked as \"delivered,\" I said no, that was the empanadas, not my meals. She said, \"Has this happened to your meals regularly?\" I guess the implication was, \"Are you claiming to have completely missing boxes regularly?\" I've been a customer for a year with very few issues (and I order 7-14 meals a week, often add on premiums like steak, lattes, shakes, etc), so I really did not like that implication and no, I have never been told that my meals had been delivered without a tracking number. I said that I never even got a shipping notification about the meals, ONLY the empanadas??!?!? I asked her for a tracking number of these meals that were delivered. She gave me the tracking number for the empanadas, which matched up with the Factor email about shipping them. I said \"this is for the empanadas, do you have the tracking number for my meals you said were delivered??\" she said no, she assumed they would all be delivered together. I told her the email and website specifically told me many times they would be delivered SEPARATELY. She said they should have been delivered altogether?!?! That goes entirely against what the website and emails say.\n\nThey did give me credits quickly, but it left kind of a bad taste in my mouth, I felt like I was being accused of lying or something when I never even got an EMAIL that the Factor meals were shipped. And she started out very nice to me and seemed to get increasingly suspicious. The whole thing is bizarre and I definitely won't be adding on frozen foods anymore, because I feel like that somehow glitched my entire delivery and put the blame on me?? It appears that reps cannot see the difference between bundles being shipped and meals, or even know that they ship separately, which is a massive issue considering customers are told many times that they ship separately. And then as a result they imply we are liars and ask questions like, \"does this regularly happen to you?\" YOU are the ones who never shipped it! \n\nNOTE: if you get credits for next weeks meal, make sure you have enough meals to actually use up the entire credits refunded, because they will NOT roll over into the next week. I added on a couple more meals to fix this issue.",

What are people using that is good? \n\nIn the past I've used cookunity, but I was pretty disappointed in the combo of portion size / quality / cost. This was maybe 4 years ago though, so I'd be curious to hear what people who are using it now think.\n\nIt would also be great if the meals were health focused and high protein, but this is just a \"nice to have\" for me and not necessary.\n\nThanks!",

I had my first ever delivery scheduled for monday since that is what was most convenient for me. Unfortunately my order was delayed but that isn\u2019t the biggest issue here. I got my box today but all the food was warm and the ice was melted completely and wasn\u2019t even cold either. The reason I did not have my delivery set to tuesday is that I knew i was going to be away from my apartment from 9-9 and if the food was delivered in that time, I would not be able to get it from the lobby and refrigerate it in good timing. Around the time I received the email that it would be delayed, the factor website said that it had already been delivered (not true). So I have no idea when the box arrived so I didn\u2019t know the food was safe. I bring this up to customer service and they say the box will be arriving on wednesday which is weird since I was looking right at it. Obviously my problem doesn\u2019t follow the script so a refund feels out of the question :/. does anyone know of any similar services that deliver to the kingston ontario area?",
