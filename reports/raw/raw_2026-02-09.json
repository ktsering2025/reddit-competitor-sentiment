Slimy, unusable, but not actually rotten. But their prep and bake chicken cutlets were magnificent, juicy and tender, every time. Hello Fresh chicken cutlets are dry and tough, every time. These are the differences I have seen: the Hello Fresh cutlets are about half the thickness of the Home Chef cutlets, but they seem to be the same overall quantity. The Hello Fresh cutlets are baked for 20 to 25 minutes at 450\u00b0 on the top rack, while the Home Chef cutlets are baked for about the same time but at 425\u00b0 on the center rack. The topping on the Hello Fresh chicken is always way overcooked, too, even burnt. Do you think I might have better luck using the Home Chef cooking temperature and rack, and just using my thermometer for timing? I want to add that this issue has persisted through an oven change, so it\u2019s not a quirk of my oven.",

I\u2019ll just season the shrimp with fajita seasoning, no biggie, but this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve noticed it in the last few weeks.

Stuff like \u201cDO NOT BEND,\u201d no obvious branding, looks like it could be important/confidential and no Sender details\u2026 and then you open it and it\u2019s just a HelloFresh ad/coupon.\n\nI actually emailed them about it over a month ago and they responded saying they removed my address from future communications. However a month later\u2026 another one shows up that looks like a time-sensitive tax document again. So clearly whatever \u201cremoval\u201d they did didn\u2019t work (or their mail vendor is still blasting it out).\n\nIt\u2019s honestly the opposite of effective marketing. If the goal is to win people back, this does the REVERSE imo. I\u2019m not signing up (or signing back up) for a service that thinks deceptive \u201clooks like official mail\u201d tactics are okay. It feels like guerrilla marketing and it\u2019s gross.\n\nHas anyone else been getting these? If you got them to stop, what worked? Is this coming from HelloFresh directly or some third-party marketing list?\n\nAt this point I\u2019m just documenting everything and escalating every time it happens, because I don\u2019t know what else to do.

      "selftext": "In case anyone is considering signing up... I signed up approximately a month ago because I was tired of figuring out what to cook, and I saw someone on this subreddit claiming that Marley Spoon is similar to Plated (which is gone, sadly). The first box was missing one of the recipe cards, which was a minor inconvenience. Then I noticed that several of the recipes I chose required that I julienne the vegetables, which is a major inconvenience considering that meal kits are supposed to save time. The ingredients were tossed haphazardly in the box instead of being separated by recipe. Future boxes were missing all or most of the recipe cards. After deciding the food was just ok and not worth the trouble, I cancelled.\n\nUpon cancelling, I received a message that I was still going to receive one final box. So I had an unwanted charge on my card and an unwanted box of food to deal with. The final box, unsurprisingly, was missing a recipe card and apparently you can't view the recipe on their website with reactivating your account, so I reactivated for ONE HOUR so I could view the recipe. Well, that one hour gave them the go ahead to charge my card again and immediately ship me another box (and they chose the recipes). I tried to email customer service but they waited to respond until after the box was delivered and told me \"oops, too late.\" So here I am with another unwanted box (which had kale in it \ud83e\udd22). I asked the customer service rep to confirm that my account was fully cancelled and that there would be no future charges, and they did.\n\nNow, this morning, two days later, I have ANOTHER pending charge from Marley Spoon on my card and will have to go through the headache of disputing the charge and potentially wasting a box full of kale and onions, or whatever else they arbitrarily decide to send.\n\nTl;dr AVOID THIS COMPANY LIKE THE PLAGUE",

I hadn't even thought much about it, but instead of having 1 sauce and green beans, it had 2 cups of sauce and no green beans.  This was from my Jan. 28th delivery service.\n\nI had additional meals delivered on February 4th.  Put the meals in the fridge and set the box near the front door.  A day or two later, I took the box to the dumpster, and upon lifting it, noticed that one of the refrigerant packs had leaked and it was wet under the box.\n\nYou can see the result.  Apparent damage to my black marble entryway, that so far, I cannot remove.\n\nNot having good luck w/Factor over the past couple of weeks.  When it rains, it pours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7qxt6a116ig1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51c27ecaadd8496fd899e2e5b83db01422b0e799\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pf4z6a116ig1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52e4f84dab94edbe7eb1be7f200553c6593d8dd8\n\n",

So you call and they refund shipping and give you $100 credit. \n\nNext week has already billed and shipped before they issue the credit.\n\n  \nWeek after, you spend $120+shipping on a meal. The invoice says you spent $20+used a $100 credit + shipping. But it doesn't get delivered because of weather. So you call. They refund the shipping and credit you back the paid amount on the invoice: $20.\n\nSo at this point you are out pocket $100 for meals that you didn't get.  ",

No, it wasn\u2019t a huge fire, but I could see orange flames, so I turned off the microwave and removed the dinner, which was still smoking heavily.\n\nYou can see that the area of the tray where the cup used to be was the part lit on fire, and it looked like the other one was starting to burn, and probably would\u2019ve done so if I hadn\u2019t been in the kitchen to shut things down fast.\n\nI was pretty surprised by this. If someone had put it into the microwave, and not been standing right next to it, I think it could\u2019ve potentially started a fire. It was kind of one of those WTF moments.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking if I ate the dinner, I did, smoky flavor at all. I just transferred it to a different plate, and I added the cups of sauce, even though they didn\u2019t give me those instructions.",

I called the number on the website and the representative kept condescendingly telling me the steps of how to place an order, as if I haven't been doing it for 2 years. I've never recieved meat before now. I asked for a refund and the rep just kept repeating the steps of how to place an order. I repeated that this is ridiculous and he insisted that there was no issue and I must be ordering meat if I recieved meat. He told me he'd email me a step by step way to make my account vegan, and then preceded to send me steps on how to place an order. With the message \"it seems like you may not be understanding how to place an order that you want. Do not select the meals you do not wish to recieve\". I swear to god. I can provide screenshot to prove this was a real conversation. I think the factor phone representative is gaslighting me. I've never had a more infuriating customer service experience.\n\nI genuinely think this guy was fucking with me.\n\nI decided to use the chat feature on the website to report how fucking bizzare that representative was with me and that I needed to get a refund for the above reasons and it kept spitting out the same response over and over \"which item was missing from your order?\". No one is trying to help in the slightest. I'm genuinely considering canceling my subscription over this.",
