But, if you look at the recipe online, the card, and the ingredients list, they don\u2019t include pepper jack cheese, cream cheese, scallions, or most importantly, jalape\u00f1os. The description of the recipe says that there\u2019s cream cheese, pepper jack cheese, scallions, white cheddar cheese, and jalape\u00f1o. But when I get the order, it doesn\u2019t have a jalape\u00f1o in the bag. If I recall correctly, everything else was there. \n\nI still order them, because we really like them and it\u2019s not easy to find wonton wrappers in my immediate area. I just make sure to get jalape\u00f1os when I do order them (like next week). I have called HelloFresh to ask about it, and the rep very graciously gave me a partial credit for the lacking jalape\u00f1o. \n\nI guess this is to warn anyone else who might order them: they are delicious, just make sure you have a jalape\u00f1o if you order them.

      "selftext": "\n\nCancelled account via app. App did not record cancellation. (\"Glitch\"). Second time in six months btw, I had signed back up hoping for a better experience.\n\n\nNoticed I was  charged on deadline date- cancelled again after date (successful now that it was too late, surprise!) and sent emails describing what happened and trying to get refund since it was within like an hour of charge. No dice, no answer. Fine. Figured I'd eat the final week and whatever. \n\nToday is delivery day. No delivery. Initiated chat on app - agent says he can't help me since I cancelled after deadline and says order is out for delivery. I ask for tracking, he disconnects. \n\nThen I get a weird set of frantic calls and texts from an Uber driver. Had no idea Uber delivered for them. Was confused for the first 5 minutes of the conversation. Turns out hellofresh canceled the delivery mid-process and the Uber driver was complaining that he didn't know what to do because now they were refusing to pay him. I told him I had nothing to do with it and it was a subscription service that had been canceled by the company, so his best bet was to turn around and bring it back to the warehouse, which he did and sent me proof. \n\nInitiated chat again and got as far as the agent asking me to email them proof from the Uber driver which I did and then they disconnected again. \n\nInitiated chat again and got another agent refusing to help me. \n\nSo I initiated a refund request with PayPal. Tried to chat one more time figuring if they would help me. I would be able to cancel the PayPal case, and the agent got rude with me and told me that since I filed a claim with my bank they were no longer willing to help me. \n\nI'm sure I'll eventually get refunded (I hope), but yea....never again. Terrible customer service and so difficult to get anyone to attempt help in the first place. ",

      "selftext": "Update #1: 1/1/26 - I checked the portal to see if they fixed the issue with my promotions, instead of fixing it, they removed all of the promotions and now everything is at regular price. Thank god I took screenshots of the chat with the agent, this is going to be helpful when I file my complaint with the state.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nI wanted to share my experience with signing up for Hello Fresh. I was hesitant about signing up after reading all of the complaints online, but I figured let me try this out and see how it goes, and I can always cancel if it doesn't work out. I understand that for every bad experience there are probably 100 good ones, but people don't generally take to social media to post that everything went right, just when things go wrong.. so I kept this in mind and signed up.\n\nHere is my experience so far:\n\nI am a new customer and signed up with a promotion for \"10 free meals, first box ships free, free breakfast for life, and a free zwilling knife\".\n\nI didn't get the ability to order a free breakfast item, so I contacted chat support. They kept lying to me, no doubt hoping I'd just let it go, but I am not one to do that.  Here are the lies they told me:\n\n\"Your promotion doesn't include the free breakfast item for life\"\n\n\"The free breakfast for life promotion is only good on your first box\" (Huh?  Really??)\n\n\"There was an error adding that promotion to your account, so I've provided you a $15 credit to make up for it instead\"\n\nThis is all on the same chat, they will literally say anything just to get you to hang up.  I made it clear that while this trick might work on most people, it won't work on me, and if they don't provide the promotional offers which I have documentation of, and were the reason why I signed up, I'm happy to forward all of my documentation to the various consumer protection agencies it was becoming pretty clear that bait and switch is their promotional business model.\n\nThe rep changed their tune quickly and magically \"fixed the issue\" and said I could order the free item starting with my next box.\n\n12/31, I go to order my next box, and I still don't have the ability to order the free breakfast item.  I opened up a chat support window where I had to repeat everything all over again as they claimed they don't have access to previous support chats.  I went through the same exact BS as the previous chat, with the majority of the conversation clearly a copy / paste from their  script.   Once again they offered a coupon code as a resolution, and that is not acceptable to me.  While I was typing to explain this to them, I received an email that my Hello Fresh account was \"cancelled and we're sorry to see you go!\"\n\nThe rep CANCELLED my account without my request or consent.\n\nI immediately asked the rep what is going on, and they lied saying they didn't do anything and my account was \"active\".\n\nI log in and check, and apparently they closed my account, then re-opened my account with a different promotion code that doesn't include any of the things I was originally entitled to.\n\nSo far I only ate one meal, and I was impressed with the food quality, variety, and concept, but I can't say the aggravation, frustration, and fraudulent practices are worth the benefit. Their business practices at best, are questionable, if not fraudulent. \n\nBe warned... Hello Fresh and their promotions, are a scam at minimum.\n\n\n",

We have old faithful recipes, and we love to mix it up with new ones. Seriously no complaints. There\u2019s been the occasional missed ingredient, missing recipe card, and one time the wrong meal. But in hundreds of boxes, a handful of errors is nothing to complain about. Their customer service is always quick to apologize and credit our account when they\u2019ve made an error. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts about AI cards, mistakes in directions/recipes, pictures of ingredients that look woefully inadequate. It\u2019s making me nervous that we are about to see a sharp and dramatic decline in the quality of our deliveries. Nevertheless, week after week, we are happy. The quality hasn\u2019t diminished in the slightest. Literally my ONLY complaint is the duck al\u2019 orange has DISAPPEARED. We used to get it every time it was offered. It\u2019s incredible. And we haven\u2019t seen it offered in years. It\u2019s sad. And I even asked about it, but the representative didn\u2019t seem to know. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, we live in Connecticut. Are  the problems people are experiencing regional? Am I missing something? \n\nBonus points if anyone has advice on my duck dilemma. But I\u2019m willing to look past it. \n\n",

Also taste and then if you\u2019re able to compare it to the \u201csales photo\u201d in similarity. Also simplicity to make or if it\u2019s a difficult recepie then how in depth are the instructions.

It works perfectly for me as a single guy. \n\nMy box arrived on time and the organization HF uses is amazing!\n\nThe recipe cards are easy to follow, the ingredients all came nice and cold thanks to the special cold pack they used and each meal comes with a paper bag full of the ingredients for each meal! All of it comes perfectly portioned for what you need to make the meal. \n\nIt\u2019s a very clean efficient system setup. \n\nThe last pic is the first meal I cooked from the batch. Pepper jack chicken and rice! \ud83d\ude0b Twas delicious!\n\nI\u2019m excited to see how this works out for me in weight loss and just eating healthier overall. It\u2019s definitely been worth it so far. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb \n\nHas anyone here else used Hello Fresh? How\u2019d you like it?",

Thanks in advance for any insight.\n\n1. \u2060We are vegetarian / pescatarian. I only see three vegetarian dishes this week. Coming from Hello Fresh, this selection seems underwhelming. Also - is there no way to put your dietary requirements in your profile? I only see allergens. Would prefer not to scroll through all the chicken and beef dishes.\n2. I\u2019ve seen nothing but good reviews on multiple platforms, but actually looking at what you get for your money, I can\u2019t imagine what would merit such good reviews. It makes me doubtful. I am seeing $80 for a few slabs of tofu for a family of 4. Then I need to add $60 broccoli to this to make a meal. I\u2019ve also read the meal portions are small. $140 for what looks like very plain, simple food? Can someone make sense of this for me. We shop at Whole Foods and The Fresh Market so are used to higher prices, but this seems kind of crazy.\n3. The website seems really confusing to use. I signed up for a plan but there\u2019s no count when I\u2019m choosing dishes. Why don\u2019t they give you a count of how many you\u2019ve chosen and how many you have left to choose? Also no filter function. I know this is minor, but seems like it\u2019s lacking functionality other sites have.\n\nI\u2019m about to hit cancel, but please let me know if I have any of this wrong? Why does it get such positive reviews?",

And the flavours were super boring - if I wanted basic ass chicken potatoes and beans, I would not bother ordering premade meals. \n\nI get that it's my fault that I forgot about the order but I think that the auto select needs to do a better job of having variety. I've cancelled my plan for now so this doesn't happen again.\n\nIt's one thing to forget and end up with $200 of food I didn't mean to order but it sucks when it is bland and boring chicken. \n",

      "title": "Factor Thoughts After 2 Weeks",
      "selftext": "I used Factor75 for 2 weeks. Here is just a quick rundown of my thoughts.\n\n**Convenience & Arrival Time:** I really enjoyed the fact that I didn't have to think about lunch/dinner. Very convenient for taking to work. I also thought they shipped quickly and I thought the packaging was decent. **4/5.**\n\n**Quality & Consistency:** The quality is inconsistent. The very first meal I tried was chicken breast based and the meat was so dry and chewy. So I was like, okay, I guess that's just how it is. But most of the other pieces of meat from other meals were completely fine. The green beans were always very chewy. The potatoes were fine but I didn't like how they tasted microwaved. If I was at home, I ended up popping them in the air fryer so they were crispy. \n\nI also tried one of their free breakfasts. Red velvet pancakes and sausage. I threw the sausage away because it tasted like soggy cardboard to me. I did order their juices and I liked them so much I wish they had a way to order those separately. **3/5.** \n\n**Variety:** I don't eat red meat much and I don't trust fish from a box that I need to microwave, so my options were limited to white meat or pork chop. Most the meals I tried were versatile, but corn/beans/dairy don't sit well with me. So I did experience some gas. If I avoided the meals with those ingredients, I would have been left with the blander options. I also skipped a week because the options didn't excite me. **This me being a picky eater and not really a Factor issue.**  **3.75/5** \n\n**Health:** I liked how high-protein most of the options, and the variety and calorie options. There are a lot of sauces. I think I'd prefer if they season up the meat and veggies more have less sauces but I also understand that seasoning amount depends on the individual. They can't cater to everyone's taste buds, but I just felt that some of the sauces were heavy. I only used a small amount. (I know I can season it myself but I felt like the flavor would be off if I threw some on after microwaving it). **3.75/5**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nI think if you don't have as much dietary concerns, this is a decent option. It is above quality in store-bought microwave meals in terms of sodium and calories but the reason I didn't continue is the lack of consistency in quality. One week the meat is dry and over cooked, the next the meat is juicy. And the veggies and potatoes left something more to be desired. \n\nI don't see myself using it again. I think I'm just a picky eater and have minor dietary concerns, which means I don't get much versatility. I still recommend it as my S.O. has been enjoying his boxes and he plans to continue with his subscription. \n\n**Overall:** 7/10\n\n\n\n",

I don't mind trying to split it up between meal delivery and cooking as long as it's easier recipies.\n\nI've been looking through a few ready meal options to try but we need something a bit under $100 a week. I've looked through Factor, EveryPlate. I even looked at some meal kits for easier recipies for me to cook like Dinnerly. I want something at least healthy enough to where they don't use much oil however still actually use seasonings because I have a hard time with bland food and used to Asian cuisine and flavors.\n\nI am literally just kind of lost because I've never tried a meal delivery service before and don't know what to expect and what would be best for me and my partner.\n\nThank you to anyone who helps!!\n\nEDIT: I want to specify that the lowest I've found was about $6.99 a meal + $10.99 shipping. if there's anything lower than that, please let me know!",

      "selftext": "Questionable title for this post aside, how is the meat from Hungryroot?\n\nI've been using HR for a year and half and have had to skip a few deliveries due to either complications making delivery impossible, or us not being home to receive it package in time. Each time we've skipped, I've had to rely on supermarket meat, namely chicken, beef, steak, and occasionally seafood. \n\nWhat I've noticed is that each time I've eaten store-bought meat, I feel a lot more depressed than usual, and have more digestive issues than when I eat meat from HR. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this with anything between supermarket and Hungryroot groceries? Moreover, why is HR meat different? I know they vacuum seal meats, but do they have healthier sources? Or have they mastered JIT storage and shipping processes to keep the meat healthy?",

Up until now I\u2019ve just been writing them on the recipe paper that comes in the box. This works ok bc I can also make notes about any tweaks we made to the recipe in the same place. However, this is not going to be a great method for going back to find specific recipes to see how we liked it or if I\u2019m just looking for some that we ranked high to add to my order. \n\nDoes anyone else keep a record of the recipes you have tried and how you liked them? How do you store that information for easy access later? ",

The portions have shrunk to the point where we have to make another meal afterwards. When they started sending one small steak to split between two people, I thought ok, that seems a little skimpy. They used to send two. But now they sent a lone peanut butter and jelly sandwich as a fricking dinner meal? I immediately cancelled the service. I can do bad all by myself.",
