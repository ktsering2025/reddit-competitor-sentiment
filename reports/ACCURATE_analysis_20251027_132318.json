We are looking for ways to save money and budget more, especially since I am in college and he is in his first year of his first full-time job. I have tried HelloFresh in the past and it's great for single life, not so sure about married life. I have done a little bit of research into Thrive Market and HungryRoot, but I am not sure which would be the best option. Should I just stick to my local store and/or Walmart? Or should I try a food/grocery/meal prep service? What are your guys' opinions, what have you tried, and what works best for a tight budget?",

I made the first one last night (mustard soy salmon) and it was shocking how quickly the salmon was devoured.\n\n\n\nI have one kid who really struggles with food (esp new foods) and they inhaled the salmon. I actually gave half their portion to my husband bc I figured kid wasn't going to be interested in something that different and new. Now I feel bad because they would have eaten the whole thing!\n\n\n\nWhile I agree that the protein portions were a little on the small side (though double would have been too much), I feel like the rice and carrots more than made up for it. The rice they send for 4 people is A LOT for us, which is fine bc my kids will eat plain rice as leftovers :D I didn't even cook all of the carrots because those suckers were HUGE, and we still had leftovers which I'll happily eat for lunch.\n\n\n\nI really appreciated the balance of ease in cooking on a weeknight with the flavors being interesting, like adding lime zest to the roasted carrots.\n\n\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't get a photo before everyone CHOWED DOWN. I promise this is not an ad, lol.",

          "selftext": "I'm looking for a pre-made meal service that is like Factor 75 with healthier choices (high protein, low carb, low calorie) but not Factor 75. Or CookUnity. Or Hungryroot.\n\nI liked Factor at first but I kept getting the same 5 meals and the portion/quality changed. Missing ingredients (like no cheese in cauliflower mac n cheese) and everything was broccoli. Like...everything. And it was one stalk of broccoli. But I liked that the calories were in range, it was gluten free and low carb. \n\nI tried cook unity and I hate it. It's too much salt and everything is so high in calorie content. I found myself spending more time looking for healthy meals and it always came down to the same 3-4 meals as a result. \n\nI signed up for Hungryroot and immediately cancelled it. It's too confusing and I just want a meal plan-not a plan that changes based on the amount of credits attached to the meal I choose. \n\nSo with that info...can anyone suggest a plan that is healthy and moderately low in calories that also leans into gluten free?

We like them because of how convenient they are and the fact that they have more choices than most other services we used before. \n\nWe usually get our deliveries on sundays. \n\nBut this week, for the first time, nothing. We didn't get anything. They charged our credit card, but the box hasn't even been shipped yet. We thought, maybe we'l get it tomorrow, but no. It is now 2 days late, and no sign of any movement. \n\nFrom what I've seen on there, I'm guessing we'll be getting spoiled food when we finally receive it. \n\nWe've been trying to reach out to their support, but they keep extending the delay of their anwser. They're like \"We'll be with you in 40 minutes\" and 40 minutes later, they extend the wait time some more, and then 15 minutes later, they extend it again. It seems like there is no customer service at all. \n\nAt this point, I don't think we'l be getting our food... And even if we do, I'm afraid the ice will have melted by then and that the food will be spoiled. \n\nI assumed customer service would be able to help, but they're just absent. \n\nThis experience is making us rethink our subscribtion. \n\nWhat are your experiences with their customer service?\n\n\n",

I generally think that Factor75 is a good concept for someone like me but I am 5 deliveries in and having my 2nd box with a delivery delay. The first box was supposed to arrive on a Monday and it got to me on Thursday so it was all bad and I had to throw it away. Customer service \u201crefunded\u201d me\u2026.come to find out they credit my account for the cost but they won\u2019t use any credits towards discounted boxes so now I am out the discount of the box that was part of the reason I gave this a trial again and have $93 sitting in my account that I can\u2019t use. If this box does the same where I have to throw away this food and they credit my account then I am DONE. \n\nIs anyone else having issues with delivery? ",
