It is super convenient and helps me eat less takeout. \n\nA few months ago, they mentioned they were going to increase the quality of their meat, which I thought was great. Their meat was never terrible to me (it was fine). Not high quality, but still fine. However, since about a month ago, I have found their meat to be quite awful, particularly the ground meat (including sausage). It seems to be filled with a lot of filler or something because it reminds me almost of hot dogs if they were ripped into pieces, but ofc, the taste is not the same as hot dogs but it also doesn't taste like it should. I have never experienced this with ground meats that I purchased elsewhere... \n\nI am definitely going to cancel next month (my partner asked we do it for the next month as we are busy) and, in the meantime, avoid the ground meats but it is unfortunate because they are often in quicker meals. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this? Or willing to pay attention? ",

In the past, I always knew about the different special collections- like the 'Fall Flavors' category, etc.  I remember when I would see snowmen made out of mashed potatoes, or when there was Hispanic Heritage month, with special meals with South American flavors, etc.  I always read about the collections, got excited about new meals, etc.\n\nToday I was choosing some meals, and I came across something from The Office.  And another one that was like 'Meals with a Purpose' or something like that.  And when they have these, I wonder what the theme is, etc.  Like I saw Kevin's Chili, I assume there are other, similar meals?\n\nWhen my kids were younger, there were a few collections that we really liked.  It was always fun to try the new items to change it up.  There was a Guardians of the Galaxy thing, and I believe we got every meal, because there was some sort of collectible in them.\n\nDoes anyone know where we can read about the new collections?

I created an account, selected my meals and breakfast add on and applied the code. Then I noticed something strange. The breakfast add on is still being charged full price. Talked to support and they told me I need to manually select the add on since it's not added automatically. Well that's what I did. It was very clear this support person didn't even read my issue properly. From looking at the posts here, it seems the free breakfast is on a different tab, but I never saw it- hence my immense confusion. The dodgy answer from support also didn't help.\n\nRegardless I asked them to cancel my order and my subscription. No thanks. Hope y'all are enjoying this but  it isn't worth it for me.",

Tell them they forgot to put ice in the box? Tell them none of the meat was in there? Dispute it on my credit card? I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s unethical. Read below if you wanna know what lead to me being this discontent with them.  \n\nHey there, I\u2019m greatly disappointed with HelloFresh\u2019s customer service level. I signed me and my wife up for 4 meals a week under the free caraway pan promo. I understand that you are eligible for the pan after your 3rd box and a redemption code will be sent to your email within 14 days after receiving the 3rd box.\n\nI started the subscription 8 weeks ago. I bought the first 5 boxes when when I still hadn\u2019t got a code I decided to pause until I received my promo so I had skipped what would be the 6th and 7th box and reached out twice over email asking about the caraway code. The first email never got a response, the second email literally said nothing other than the phone number to call into support. I tried to call but it was out of office hours so I didn\u2019t speak to anyone. I\u2019ve been working a lot lately so it fell to the back of my mind for a couple days as I planned on calling them later on. Well then I seen a charge notification go through on my Apple Pay. This was for the next box (what would be #8) I will admit that I forgot to skip it on my end. The charge took place around midnight so the phone line was closed but I made sure to reach out to them at 8am the following morning. The lady asked me why I wanted to skip and I told her that I meant to skip because 1. I haven\u2019t received my pan promo I signed up for 2. Because since it was meant to be skipped we didn\u2019t go select the meals and due to my wife dietary restrictions 2 or the 4 meals that were auto selected wouldn\u2019t be useable for us anyways. \n\nShe then told me they are getting more pan codes and that I should have one soon but to call back in 3-5 days if I haven\u2019t got it yet, well ok. Now I will say she was very nice on the phone but when moved we onto the box I was trying to cancel she told me that it couldn\u2019t be done because the box was already made?! (Keep in mind this was on Thursday morning and my box shows up Monday so I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a lie. I expressed that it\u2019s wild that they force me be ok with it when I reached out less than 12 hours after the charge and the box is still days away from being shipped but when It comes to them being weeks late on my pan I\u2019m suppose to just be alright with a sorry and continue to wait on the premise \u201cwe we get it to you eventually\u201d. She apologized but restated there was nothing she could do other than bring up my feedback. I told her I just wanted my pan and that outside of that I would be canceling my service with them. How to do get my money back on this box? I understand I\u2019m a fault for not skipping it in time but there should have been some sort of resolution available other than tough luck, especially given that I\u2019ve been patient with them not holding up their end of the bargain on my promo.

          "full_text": "Want to start off by saying that I obviously enjoy using Hellofresh, having been a customer since 2018. When I got my first place a couple of years ago, Hellofresh was super useful to mitigate some of the stress of moving in and figuring out what to cook. I also greatly improved my cooking ability over the years thanks to the recipes.\n\nWhich makes it all the more sad to see the current state of things. I read their latest available annual report where they suggest that they\u2019re trying to increase revenue of recurring (aka loyal) customers through up charges like marketplace and premium meals. \n\nI remember when premium meals were first introduced, and they legitimately felt \u201cpremium\u201d given the volume and quantity of food you receive. Things like the salmon Wellington for example were quite elaborate and felt unique. Nowadays half the options are premium, often times completely inexplicably. I don\u2019t understand how adding 3 strips of bacon to an otherwise typical meal justifies a $10 up charge. I understand that they barely increased the base box prices over almost a decade, but honestly I would rather the base increase than have every decent looking meal be an upcharge. \n\nThe ingredient quantity and quality has also plummeted. The meat I receive is just plain gross to the point that I absolutely dread opening the meat packets. I\u2019m actually in awe every time I buy grocery store ground beef and notice the pleasant smell and lack of sliminess compared to what HF is sending. And we all know about the \u201cshredded chicken\u201d scraps they send by now.\n\nThere are also notable omissions from recipes when you compare to years ago. One easy example is the salsas that come with Mexican dishes - often times the \u201csalsa\u201d is just a diced up tomato soaked in lime juice. In years past they\u2019d set you up with a full pico de gallo.\n\nThen there\u2019s small details which aren\u2019t super relevant, but cheapen the overall experience. Lately I\u2019ve been getting TreStelle \u201ccream cheese product\u201d instead of actual cream cheese. I would never buy and ingest this junk on my own volition, yet I use it through HF. Honey and vinegar used to come in miniature bottles, now they\u2019re just blank transparent packets. Not the end of the world, but kind of crummy for a meal kit that used to be positioned as the premium option.\n\nEven though the menu is multiple times bigger than what it used to be years ago, it is substantially harder to decide on 3-5 meals that aren\u2019t just week to week repeats. Also, they decided to pollute the menu options with factor meals - if I wanted to order factor, I\u2019d order factor. They should at minimum be tucked away behind a tab like the marketplace items.\n\nAnyway, I just felt like sharing my perspective on what I see as a major degradation in a once amazing service. I hope that they can recover but it\u2019s surely not easy in these economic times.",

Blue Apron or both, like me!\n\nFamily?\u00a0 Hello Fresh\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Overall Winner: Hello Fresh**\u00a0\n\n**Recipe Quality**\n\nFresh meats and veggies from both.\n\nHF offers more family-friendly foods with the same base: chicken, pork, potato wedges, mashed potatoes, and broccoli.\n\nBA offers much fancier recipes with unusual ingredients \u2013 perfect for impressing a date or cooking together. I love eating fancy foods with flair!\n\nWinner: BA\n\n**Number of recipes**\n\nHands down, HF offers far more recipes.\u00a0 For 3/15/25, there are approximately 62 meals, six of those are prepared microwaveable meals, and three are prep and bake.\n\nBA offers 20 options. Two are ready to cook, and none are microwaveable.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Premium meals**\n\nBecause HF offers many more meals, more are premium than BA. From my experience, all of the meals involving fish are considered premium and cost more (approximately $9 more per serving). BA routinely includes fish in its base price (shrimp, codfish, tilapia, and salmon) and I love fish and not having to pay extra for it with BA.\n\nLooking at the menu, BA offers only one premium meal: Duck Confit &amp; Coconut Curry Ramen, which costs $18.98 per serving.\u00a0\n\nHF has six premium meals, including Shoyu-Style Ramen with Sesame-Soy Salmon for 8.99 per service.\n\nThe recipes HF charges extra for would typically be part of BA\u2019s base plan.\u00a0 I have not ordered premium meals from either.\n\nWinner: Tie.\u00a0 HF is cheaper and has more options.\u00a0 But fish is standard fare for BA and is always offered.\n\n**Specialty Meals:**\n\nLooking for big-batch meals, casseroles, or slow-cooker options: HF.\u00a0 BA doesn\u2019t offer these.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Add ons:**\u00a0\n\nBoth have upsells after you\u2019ve selected your meals for the week, but HF has many more options: smoothies (sometimes sold out), breakfast items, and decadent desserts.\u00a0 I\u2019ve ordered desserts from HF twice: blueberry cake and hazelnut cheesecake.\u00a0 I ordered one and received two servings of each. The cake was microwaveable. Both were delicious but high in calories and fat, which isn\u2019t viewable online.\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Order correctness**\n\nThere have been no issues with HF yet. BA has sent me the wrong delivery once. I was looking forward to my salmon meal, too. Instead of one, I received three meals instead of two, including fried chicken, falafel salad, and chorizo enchiladas. I try to stay on the lighter side of calories, but of course, I made the dishes. BA responded quickly via email and refunded my meal for that week.\u00a0\n\nWinner:\u00a0 HF\n\n**Packaging**\u00a0\n\nI love HF\u2019s packaging!\u00a0 Both of my recipes come in separate brown paper bags. I can just open the box and pop the bags in the fridge.\u00a0 Look underneath the cardboard divider for meats and pop in the freezer.\u00a0\n\nBA just tosses all the individual ingredients in a box like: YOU figure it out!\u00a0\n\nI like that BA lets you know the ice product is sink-friendly.\u00a0 HF does not say that, so I toss the heavy packaging.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**App**\u00a0\n\nBoth apps are easy to navigate and have the recipes cards in the app in the event you lose yours.\u00a0 They both have filters so you can get to your low-calorie, vegetarian or Bestseller meals quickly. I like that HF's front menu page shows the calorie content.\u00a0\n\nWinner HF\u00a0\n\n**Repetitiveness**\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been using the services for three months and still haven\u2019t bought the same meal twice, although I easily could. Because HF has so many options, many are repeated often. The Honey Onion Crunch Chicken is almost always on the menu. That was my first dish, and it is an easy-to-make one-pan meal and delicious! I can\u2019t wait to have it again.\u00a0\n\nBA doesn\u2019t repeat meals as often, but its unique ingredients make regular appearances. So, it has multiple recipes that use the same ingredients in its stock.\n\nWinner: BA has less repetitive/boring recipes even if they reuse ingredients.\n\n**Affordability**\u00a0\n\nI order two meals each week from each (which is four meals). I think I\u2019m still getting a discount from HF and pay about $55. BA is $10-12 more. Sometimes, with HF, I order an extra microwaveable meal for about $8 (two meals). When my HF discount is over, I should be paying about $10 more.\u00a0\n\nBA is more expensive. But the quality of their food and recipes justify the price. I do wish they\u2019d spend money on brown paper bags for individual recipes like HF.\u00a0\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\n\n**Taste**\u00a0\n\nBoth have good meals, and I\u2019m saving all of my recipe cards in a binder and making notes on them (although you can save them in the app, too.)\u00a0 Nothing has been awful, just items I don\u2019t prefer: like lettuce wraps from HF.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, that\u2019s Blue Apron.\n\nWinner:\u00a0 BA\n\n",

The only sauce you use is half a cup of pasta cooking water, one packet of stock concentrate, one packet of sour cream, one tablespoon butter, and some lemon juice. The second picture shows how much sauce you have before you simmer it down, for one pound of spaghetti and two chicken cutlets. It was completely devoid of flavor because there was not enough sauce by a factor of like 75%. It needed more than triple the amount of sauce it had. It said to keep adding pasta water until it was creamy, but I was just watering down water sauce by that point. Horrible. Don\u2019t get this. It needed diced tomatoes too. HF used to give tomatoes with meals like this but now they don\u2019t. Meals like this are why I\u2019m skipping most weeks now. I\u2019m not going to keep paying for bare bones meals that I have to supplement with produce and sauce. ",

Every time my box goes missing it's through the same delivery partner, FarEye. UPS, FedEx, \\_Factor... all of them have never missed the mark, but FarEye has a really high failure rate for me specifically (been at the same address). From my POV here's what happens:\n\nI get a notification that my box is out for delivery and a tracking link, later I get a notification the box was devlivered, look on my porch and it isn't there, check the devlivery link and the picture the FarEye driver is required to take isn't even a picture of the box; it's usually a picture of them pointing their camera at a random house while they drive or a picture of the inside of their trunk. I leave a one-star report, call customer service and get refunded. \n\nSo, it all works out in the end, but the fact that it's only ever FarEye and my box goes missing, not because it was delivered to a wrong address (signified by a picture of my box on someone else's door-step), but because the person flat out did not deliver the box... it seems convenient in a non-tinfoil-hat way. It's my head cannon that maybe FarEye just has low hiring standards and maybe some people are like, hey, free food for me!",

Defrosting 1 lb of ground beef is simple\u2014just leave it in the fridge overnight.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s been about 18 hours, and my 5 lb cylinder of ground venison is still pretty much frozen *solid*.\n\n***How do you safely defrost bulk meat?*** I don\u2019t care how fast or slow it takes, I just want the meat to retain quality and not go bad. Next week I am expecting a 3 lb frozen beef shoulder roast from Butcherbox, so I'm also curious how I should defrost this.\n\nThanks",

The word for chicken, g\u0101i in Cantonese and j\u012b in Mandarin, sounds like several words of good fortune.\n\nJust to name a few phrases that my parents shared with us:\n\n* h\u00f3u sai gaai \u597d\u4e16\u754c - A Cantonese phrase that roughly translates to good world, good life.\n* d\u00e0j\u00edd\u00e0l\u00ec \u5927\u5409\u5927\u5229 - A Mandarin phrase that roughly translates to great luck, great profit.\n* y\u00e1uh t\u00e0uh y\u00e1uh m\u00e9ih \u6709\u5934\u6709\u5c3e - A Cantonese phrase that literally translates to: \"has a head, has a tail.\" It means \"good beginning, good ending.\" This is one of the reasons why it's important to make a whole chicken for Lunar New Year.\n* j\u00e1au p\u00e0h j\u00e1au w\u00e0h \u6293\u6252\u6293\u93f5 - A Toisanese phrase, related to eating the chicken legs, that roughly means \"face all challenges with persistence.\"\n\nSo, basically, eat a whole chicken if you want to live. (jk)\n\n## Using a Proper Knife\n\nThe most intricate part of this recipe is the last step, where we carve up the chicken into pieces we can easily grab with a chopstick.\n\nMy dad has two knives - a \"chef's knife\", meant for vegetables and boneless meats, and a heavy duty cleaver, meant for occasions like this.\n\nIt's a lot harder to do this without a proper cleaver, so here are a few options you can look up:\n\n* Dexter Russell Heavy Duty Cleaver\n* [The same brand (not same model) as my dad's 40 year-old cleaver](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ut_sk=1.XR79XxYXt6sDAC8yCxOJl3U5_21380790_1609898344895.Copy.1&amp;id=630231282048&amp;detailSharePosition=interactBar&amp;sourceType=item&amp;suid=6C603E4D-6164-4DA8-8C61-790B2DE81EE4&amp;shareUniqueId=6881406817&amp;un=5fbdcd42b3253757dfb454b3d994b7d3&amp;share_crt_v=1&amp;spm=a2159r.13376460.0.0&amp;sp_tk=dThBVGNzQld2OWY=&amp;cpp=1&amp;shareurl=true&amp;short_name=h.4S1KiFP&amp;bxsign=scdfCTl7pW2s3tCpp7nnG1tdxUFrtYdbbyIT60TmslnzN4-9ZCBvFh4ynYYvYfyQWF2AOvFNA2Xinbs5tp8w4mgHthhB2LS4_4Gbo7_S0r1O7U&amp;sm=ddd6d0&amp;app=chrome) (ships from China)\n\nIf you don't have one, you can also try cutting at the various joints, which my dad didn't demonstrate but said is possible.\n\nYou'll also want a thick wooden cutting board which helps absorb the impact of forceful chopping.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Chinese knives, check out my [previous post on the basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/kr7bsq/basic_chinese_knife_skills_101_%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%88%80%E6%8A%80%E5%B7%A7_i_sat_down/).\n\n## Choosing a Chicken\n\nIf you're making this for Lunar New Year and following Chinese tradition, you'll need to buy a chicken that has its head, feet, toes, etc. intact.\n\nThe two main types that my dad uses are \"Yellow Hair Chicken\" and \"Kwai Fei Chicken\".\n\n* Yellow Hair Chicken tends to have more chewy meat. Many Chinese people prefer this.\n* Kwai Fei Chicken tends to have a larger quantity of meat on it, with thicker meat that's more tender.\n\nFor this specific recipe, my dad got hooked up by his old restaurant with their wholesale pricing, but you can usually buy these at an Asian grocery store or market.\n\nIf you don't have access to an Asian grocery store, you can just buy as fresh and whole of a chicken as you can get, and try to stick to a chicken that's around 4 pounds so it cooks more evenly in the pot.\n\nThe fresher the chicken, the better. And, if you can, buy it sustainably.\n\n## Sourcing Chicken Sustainably\n\nThe most environmentally friendly (and freshest) way to source chicken is to raise your own, just like my parents did back in the day.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s not easy for most of us, so some options would be to shop with a local farm or butcher, or to buy Animal Welfare Certified chicken.\n\nAmongst the strongest seals of approvals is the **Animal Welfare Certified** label from the Global Animal Partnership, a non profit originally created by Whole Foods Market in 2008.\n\nThis is one of only 3 food certification labels endorsed by the ASPCA, one of the oldest and largest humane societies in the world, the others being \u201c**Certified Humane**\u201d and \u201c**Animal Welfare Approved**.\u201d Although they\u2019re not as widespread, they set much higher standards than the more common USDA Organic certifications.\n\nIf you live in the US and feel inclined to support these causes, you can look for GAP certified meat at Whole Foods, or through Butcher Box, a popular meat delivery subscription service that sources their meats in line with all of the highest standards that we\u2019ve touched on.\n\n## The Recipe\n\nMain Ingredients\n\n* 4 lb **whole chicken** (traditionally for Lunar New Year, the chicken has its head &amp; feet intact)\n* 2 oz **green onion**\n* 1.5 oz **ginger**\n* 5 tbsp **corn oil**\n\nAdditional Flavor &amp; Seasoning\n\n* 1 tsp **salt** (for boiling water)\n* 2 tsp **salt** (for ginger scallion sauce)\n* 1 tbsp **sesame oil**\n\n# Step 1 - Boil water, add salt\n\nSet the stove to high heat and start boiling a generous amount of water in the pot you'll be using.\n\nWe'll want to be able to fully submerge our chicken in the water to make sure it cooks evenly.\n\nWe'll also be adding **1 teaspoon of salt**. My dad says not to add too much here.\n\n# Step 2 - Prepare &amp; cook chicken\n\nWait for the water to come to a boil.\n\nWe'll be doing a couple of things in this step, mostly to ensure that the entire chicken is cooked evenly for maximum tenderness.\n\n* **Pierce a hole in the skin in the neck -** This helps the water flow through the chicken cavity to help it cook more evenly.\n* **Stretch the legs away from the body several times -** This helps to avoid having a big clump of chicken meat that's undercooked.\n* **Slowly dip the chicken 3 times in the boiling water -** This helps even out the temperatures on the inside of the cavity and on the exterior of the chicken. Make sure the water is already boiling before you do this.\n* **Add the chicken and make sure it's completely submerged -** If you have to add more boiling water, do it.\n\nFrom here, we'll cover the pot.\n\nHere's a rough heat / timing overview:\n\n* Once the pot's been covered, leave it on high heat for 5 minutes as the water comes to a boil again.\n* Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for another 35-40 minutes. The larger the chicken, the longer you cook it. The sweet spot is 4 pounds.\n* Check if it's done. If so, transfer it to an ice bath. (More on both of these later.)\n\n# Step 3 - Mince scallions and ginger\n\nWhile we wait for the chicken to cook, we'll start on our sauce by mincing our **green onions** (2 oz) and **ginger** (1.5 oz)\u200b.\n\nMy dad said the exact ratio and amounts don't matter too much. Most recipes I've seen use more scallions than ginger.\n\nHaving a surplus of sauce is a great problem to have, since you can use it on pretty much everything. (I LOVE dousing my rice and vegetables in this addictive sauce)\n\nFor the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.\n\nFor the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.\n\nMy dad is using separate plates to hold the green onions and ginger. The ginger will be cooked first in the next step, so this makes it easier to separate.\n\nAlso, feel free to use a food processor here instead of mincing.\n\n# Step 4 - Heat oil, cook ginger scallions\n\nWe'll heat up our wok on high heat and add **corn oil** (5 tbsp).\n\nThe oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.\n\nA good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts \"shimmering\", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.\n\nWhy do we do this? By cooking everything in oil, we unlock the aromatics of the ginger and green onion.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.\n\n# Step 5 - Flavor the sauce\n\nWe'll add **salt** (2 tsp) and **sesame oil** (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.\n\nDo a taste test and adjust if necessary. My dad emphasized multiple times how important it is to add sesame oil here, so make sure you don't skip it.\n\n# Step 6 - Prepare an ice bath\n\nGrab a big bowl and dump a few handfuls of ice into it. Fill it roughly halfway with cold water.\n\nThe ice bath is very important - once the chicken is done cooking, we need to immediately cool it down.\n\nWhy is this so important?\n\n* **It helps the meat contract and locks the juices inside - I**f we skip this step, juices will flood out as we chop the chicken into pieces.\n* **It helps the skin stay attached -** Without this step, we'll have a bunch of loose pieces of skin everywhere.\n* **It gives the skin a bit more of a chewy texture**\n\n# Step 7 - Determine if the chicken is done\n\nOnce the time draws near, we can uncover the pot. Poke the thickest part of the chicken (around the thigh) deeply with a chopstick.\n\nIf blood or red fluid leaks out, we need to cook it for a few more minutes.\n\nIf the fluid is clear, it's ready for the ice bath.\n\nFeel free to use your newfound chicken broth however you'd like. In the video, my dad created two additional dishes (a soup and a veggie) out of it by boiling bok choy with some ginger.\n\n# Step 8 - Lift and transfer to ice bath\n\nCarefully take two chopsticks under the chicken wings, and lift it over the pot.\n\nSuspend it over the pot for 30-45 seconds to let some of the residual water drip out.\n\nThen, carefully transfer it into the ice bath. Prepare for a splash!\n\nLet the chicken sit in the bath for 5 minutes, occasionally pouring water over the surface of the chicken and rotating the chicken in the container.\n\n# Step 9 - Carve the chicken\n\nThis could honestly be its own post, but for now it will live in a very detailed step in this recipe.\n\nThis is a lot easier to follow in our video, where we dedicate about 6 minutes of time to this segment.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind before you start.\n\n* My dad\u2019s done this hundreds of times, and it took him about 10 minutes from start to finish. It\u2019ll probably take a lot longer if you\u2019re a beginner like me, but the main thing is just to make sure your cleaver is sharp and that you\u2019re moving carefully and deliberately.\u00a0\n* If you don\u2019t already have a cleaver, it\u2019s still technically possible, but I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making this dish.\n* For easier, safer cutting, you should use a larger, thicker cutting board that\u2019s preferably made of wood, and you should place a moist towel underneath it to increase its stability.\n\nHow to plate, according to Chinese tradition:\n\n* Basically everything is plated - even parts that aren't readily edible like the head.\n* Each piece of chicken is laid out on a large plate according to where it was on its body, head to toe, right to left.\n* You'll often see this served on a large oval-shaped plate.\n\nOrder of operations:\n\n* Cut off the neck and feet, cut into small pieces\n* Cut and place the head and butt at opposite ends of the middle axis of the plate\n* Remove the wings and thighs\n* Cut and split the torso into two halves (front and back)\n* Split the back in half, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut and pry away the breast bone, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut the thighs and wings into small pieces\n\nCutting techniques:\n\n* A technique my dad uses a lot involves making a shallow slice to wedge the cleaver, and then hitting down on the blade with our palm to drive the blade through the bone.\u00a0\n* In our recent knife skills interview, my dad talked about the 3 different parts of the blade - the root, the belly, and the tip. When chopping through bone, he always makes contact with the root, or the part of the blade closest to the handle.\u00a0\n\nWhen I first started this project, documenting how my dad carves a chicken was high on the list of traditions I wanted to learn and share. It always feels like I\u2019m watching an artist at work when I see my dad gracefully chop and plate everything.\u00a0\n\nEvery cut has an intention, and every piece has a place. Almost everything goes on the plate, and nothing is wasted. Especially for Lunar New Year and other celebrations, bak chit gai is meant to be one of the main decorative centerpieces on the dinner table, and carving it up into beautiful bite-sized pieces is an honor that I hope to take on one day for my own family.\u00a0\n\n# Our why\n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipes :)",

HC provides several simpler meal options, give you an idea of a meal's shelf life in order to assist prioritizing which meals to make first, provide single-use baking trays, but use a lot more plastic in packaging.\n\n**Factor\\_** \\- (apparently also owned by HF) tried them for one week. Was not impressed. For the same price as a 3-meal 2-serving shipment, you get three single-serving microwave meals. High quality, sure, and requiring minimal if no prep, but how much would you pay for a microwave meal?\n\n**Marley Spoon** \\- I'm in a trial period, and... so far, I'm a fan! (disclaimer: not an employee nor a paid sponsor) Would never stay on and pay full price, but whenever I get another offer, I'll give them another shot. I like their packaging. They have a cardboard tray with all the meals' ingredients (except the meats) plus a single ice pack, cutting down on packaging. They offer three tiers of meals, a standard selection and premium selection, but also offer a more basic selection at a reduced price, which is different. The meal portions are larger. Even when the meats are still usually 10oz portions, the other ingredients flesh it out more. One meal is two hearty servings, where with HC and HF it felt like either too much if I ate it all or not enough if I divided it into two meals. Only quibble is that both times I've had delivery issues.\n\nWhat other meal services have you used and what has been your reaction?",

HelloFresh changed my life and eating habits so this is really disappointing, but I can\u2019t keep justifying throwing $90 out the door every week. \n\nHelloFresh has significantly declined in quality the last year. I don\u2019t know if there was a change in leadership or ownership but regardless, I am appalled at how quickly the ingredients and service and customer experience degraded. And there has been 0 effort to right the wrongs.\n\n- my box this week has not been delivered, no updates on the status until I called. Only to find out it might not be delivered at all. Instead I\u2019m offered $15 in credits which does NOTHING to help the fact I have 0 meals for this week \n\n- my ingredients have routinely showed up moldy and rotting (ingredients like an onion, which take forever to go bad - how long was it sitting there) or the ingredients come water damaged or with freezer burn (zucchinis, carrots etc)\n\n- last week I was really excited to make a pasta only to find the cream sauce base exploded everywhere, therefore I could not make my pasta without it\n\n- during black history month I selected all my meals, and I was particularly excited about the bbq chicken and mac n cheese. That week I open the app only to find all my meal selections have been RESET. Nothing I chose was ordered. I furiously call and try to right this before the box ships out. I speak to someone who helps me fix my selections yet when my box shows up next week my meals are STILL WRONG. \n\n- don\u2019t even bother ordering the 15min easy prep single pan meals unless you want mushy goo that tastes like olive garden\n\n- I noticed on the recipe cards they changed all the previous terminology \u201colive oil\u201d with \u201ccooking oil\u201d and this is the biggest indicator and confirmation to me that the quality has declined, HelloFresh is cheap  and trying to appeal to a lower income customer. \n\nPEACE YALLLL see you blue aprons site ",

Hello Fresh (HF) delivers to me on Saturday, and Blue Apron (BA) on Friday.\u00a0 I enjoy both and will continue to get both because they have different strengths. I am single and order two meals per week, and they last for a minimum of four dinners.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSingle? Blue Apron or both, like me!\n\nFamily?\u00a0 Hello Fresh\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Overall Winner: Hello Fresh**\u00a0\n\n**Recipe Quality**\n\nFresh meats and veggies from both.\n\nHF offers more family-friendly foods with the same base: chicken, pork, potato wedges, mashed potatoes, and broccoli.\n\nBA offers much fancier recipes with unusual ingredients \u2013 perfect for impressing a date or cooking together. I love eating fancy foods with flair!\n\nWinner: BA\n\n**Number of recipes**\n\nHands down, HF offers far more recipes.\u00a0 For 3/15/25, there are approximately 62 meals, six of those are prepared microwaveable meals, and three are prep and bake.\n\nBA offers 20 options. Two are ready to cook, and none are microwaveable.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Premium meals**\n\nBecause HF offers many more meals, more are premium than BA. From my experience, all of the meals involving fish are considered premium and cost more (approximately $9 more per serving). BA routinely includes fish in its base price (shrimp, codfish, tilapia, and salmon) and I love fish and not having to pay extra for it with BA.\n\nLooking at the menu, BA offers only one premium meal: Duck Confit &amp; Coconut Curry Ramen, which costs $18.98 per serving.\u00a0\n\nHF has six premium meals, including Shoyu-Style Ramen with Sesame-Soy Salmon for 8.99 per service.\n\nThe recipes HF charges extra for would typically be part of BA\u2019s base plan.\u00a0 I have not ordered premium meals from either.\n\nWinner: Tie.\u00a0 HF is cheaper and has more options.\u00a0 But fish is standard fare for BA and is always offered.\n\n**Specialty Meals:**\n\nLooking for big-batch meals, casseroles, or slow-cooker options: HF.\u00a0 BA doesn\u2019t offer these.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**Add ons:**\u00a0\n\nBoth have upsells after you\u2019ve selected your meals for the week, but HF has many more options: smoothies (sometimes sold out), breakfast items, and decadent desserts.\u00a0 I\u2019ve ordered desserts from HF twice: blueberry cake and hazelnut cheesecake.\u00a0 I ordered one and received two servings of each. The cake was microwaveable. Both were delicious but high in calories and fat, which isn\u2019t viewable online.\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Order correctness**\n\nThere have been no issues with HF yet. BA has sent me the wrong delivery once. I was looking forward to my salmon meal, too. Instead of one, I received three meals instead of two, including fried chicken, falafel salad, and chorizo enchiladas. I try to stay on the lighter side of calories, but of course, I made the dishes. BA responded quickly via email and refunded my meal for that week.\u00a0\n\nWinner:\u00a0 HF\n\n**Packaging**\u00a0\n\nI love HF\u2019s packaging!\u00a0 Both of my recipes come in separate brown paper bags. I can just open the box and pop the bags in the fridge.\u00a0 Look underneath the cardboard divider for meats and pop in the freezer.\u00a0\n\nBA just tosses all the individual ingredients in a box like: YOU figure it out!\u00a0\n\nI like that BA lets you know the ice product is sink-friendly.\u00a0 HF does not say that, so I toss the heavy packaging.\n\nWinner: HF\n\n**App**\u00a0\n\nBoth apps are easy to navigate and have the recipes cards in the app in the event you lose yours.\u00a0 They both have filters so you can get to your low-calorie, vegetarian or Bestseller meals quickly. I like that HF's front menu page shows the calorie content.\u00a0\n\nWinner HF\u00a0\n\n**Repetitiveness**\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been using the services for three months and still haven\u2019t bought the same meal twice, although I easily could. Because HF has so many options, many are repeated often. The Honey Onion Crunch Chicken is almost always on the menu. That was my first dish, and it is an easy-to-make one-pan meal and delicious! I can\u2019t wait to have it again.\u00a0\n\nBA doesn\u2019t repeat meals as often, but its unique ingredients make regular appearances. So, it has multiple recipes that use the same ingredients in its stock.\n\nWinner: BA has less repetitive/boring recipes even if they reuse ingredients.\n\n**Affordability**\u00a0\n\nI order two meals each week from each (which is four meals). I think I\u2019m still getting a discount from HF and pay about $55. BA is $10-12 more. Sometimes, with HF, I order an extra microwaveable meal for about $8 (two meals). When my HF discount is over, I should be paying about $10 more.\u00a0\n\nBA is more expensive. But the quality of their food and recipes justify the price. I do wish they\u2019d spend money on brown paper bags for individual recipes like HF.\u00a0\n\nWinner: HF\u00a0\n\n**Taste**\u00a0\n\nBoth have good meals, and I\u2019m saving all of my recipe cards in a binder and making notes on them (although you can save them in the app, too.)\u00a0 Nothing has been awful, just items I don\u2019t prefer: like lettuce wraps from HF.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, that\u2019s Blue Apron.\n\nWinner:\u00a0 BA\n\n",

          "full_text": "I've been trying Hungryroot for a few months now and here's my review. \n\n1. To start, I have a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions which had me extremely stressed when trying to look up recipes and make food. I was desperate to find something to make my life easier.  I did the quiz on their website and of course they wanted me to pay before seeing the food options. No thanks. I emailed customer service and they basically gave me \"we have a lot of options so give us a try\" answer. Um, no. Not if I don't know if I can eat the food! After some back and forth and a bad review for the rep I finally received the link for all of their food options. I found a few recipes I could eat so I decided to give it a try. Sifting through the food options does become a lot easier after you sign up because you can kind of create your profile and preferences. I do not like this, I wish they were transparent about everything from the beginning.\n2. I've gotten probably 8 boxes by now, 1 has been late and some of the food was bad. I've had a few bad items in multiple boxes. I've always gotten a quick refund with extra for the inconvenience and they say they talked to the packing team. My last box was perfect so hopefully things are improving? We shall see. (Of note: customer service starting after my first interaction has been very good)\n3. I pay about $105 each week for just me. This includes \"points\" for 3 lunches, 4 dinners, and 5-7 servings of sweets. Portion sizes are huge in my opinion. I started stretching this out for almost every meal for the week. I always end up eating somewhere else for 1-2 meals for the week but the food I get from hungryroot lasts me for the rest of the week. If something tells me I can get 2 servings out of it, I can typically make it into 4 meals. I always end up having enough food to feed my husband a few meals out of the week as well.\n4. The food is pretty fresh which is a huge plus for me because I can't eat a lot of preservatives without issues. The downside is it spoils pretty quickly. I had 2 bags of mozzarella cheese in the fridge, one from Hungryroot and one from Walmart. The one from hungryroot has spoiled already in less than 2 months. \n5. 99% of the meals I've gotten take less than 20 minutes to make and are very easy. This is perfect because I really hate cooking and don't have a lot of time anyway. I did get one meal that took forever to make and it was awful so I try to keep to the more simple options. \n6. Most of the food I get is really tasty! I am a very picky eater (on top of everything else lol) so a huge plus for me.\n\nI'm conclusion, I will be keeping my hungryroot subscription because it makes my life so much easier. If I didn't have so many restrictions I probably wouldn't use it because of cost. I did look at quite a lot of meal service options and none of the others are as good for my dietary restrictions. Hope this helps someone looking into it. \n\n",

I remember the first box was huuuge and had a decent amount of snacks and breakfast options.

That box was about 3/4 to 1/2 the size of the first one and still had a few more snacks than this one. For example, the first box gave two bags of partake chocolate chip cookies. The second box had a bag of sugar cookies that was bigger than the small snack size of the chocolate chip cookie bags. This box gave a single sleeve of three partake chocolate chip cookies (they are small cookies). There are a few other snacks in this box just not as much as the first or second box.\n\nIt also just seems like less items. Has this happened to anyone else/something to worry about with them?",

          "full_text": "I have been trying Hungryroot for almost a year now. I was looking for a meal service that provided relatively quick/easy meals with minimal cooking. What I like about them is the ability to order meals (to make) but also groceries and ready-made items. I also like that they seem relatively healthy compared to other options -- more veggie options, organic, etc.\n\nI have had repeat issues with them not sending the right items -- but honestly that would be mild compared to the issues I have now had - repeatedly -- where food was not packed well and so refrigerated items did not arrive cool or cold. I do not live in a hot climate so no real excuse for this.\n\nIt seems like they have gotten worse since I first signed up and/or are cheaping out on ice packs. For my orders I used to usually have a couple of icepacks and lately it's just been one.\n\nBut the real problem is multiple times items were stored in the top of the box without any icepack.\n\nIt is incredibly frustrating to not have the food you planned on eating for the week but what is most upsetting for me is to have to throw out whole packages of food. One of the reasons I justify using mail service is to cut down on waste. \n\nOne thing I will say is that -- unlike other reviews I have read -- I have had zero problems getting ahold of customer service and every single time I have had a complaint they have given me a credit for food, refund, etc. \n\nGetting my money back hasn't been a problem -- but being able to rely on their service doesn't seem to be possible. I'll definitely keep an eye out to see if they make improvements in the future because I really do like their products. ",

It's VERY sneaky &amp; I have never experienced that before on a site. $150 is charged immediately to my card. But, okay fine, whatever - let's put that aside; I did give them my CC info after all. \n\nLATE DELIVERY, NO NOTIFICATIONS: My box was supposed to come on a Monday. Great, I made arrangements to make sure my schedule would work for that. I didn't receive any updates or notifications.....Monday night rolls around, and nothing. Shipping label says not created. ???? \n\nNO RESPONSE/NO CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER: Okay, they must be having delivery issues. I am a reasonable person. I reach out to customer service - they ONLY do email/text, no phone number. There is no opportunity to talk with someone live. \n\nTOOK OVER 2 DAYS (yes, 2 days) TO GET RESPONSE: Their automated message said \"please bear with us - higher volume than usual - will take 24-48 hours for response\". Yes, 48 hours. I'm pretty frustrated. Keep in mind, again, NO other way to contact them besides this. I'm down $150 with no meals and no one will respond to me. There is literally no way to get in touch besides email or text. \n\nI HAD TO BE PERSISTENT TO EVEN GET A RESPONSE: I'm convinced they wouldn't have even responded past 48 hours if I hadn't have kept reaching out. I give them time to respond. The 48 hour mark is approaching and I have heard NOTHING. Nada. No food, no response, and still $150 drained. $150, unfortunately, is a lot of money for me and I either need it refunded or I need my food for the week. I no longer have grocery money. So I get persistent. I text and email their support constantly. I need a response!!!! After probably my 20th text in a row (again, see: desperate) I get a response. \n\nABSOLUTELY INSANE CUSTOMER SERVICE: The customer service rep acknowledges the delay and apologizes. The rest of the message is a copy-paste nonsense that has nothing to do with me not receiving my order or the lack of communication. \"We packed your delivery specifically for you and how you live! Make sure to refrigerate!\" Um...what? I respond immediately: Where is my order, what's going on on, and I need some sort of refund. The rep says my order will now be 3 days late, possibly more. This is crazy - my week is now halfway over and I have no food and my meal planning is completely shot. I again ask for a refund. Another BS copy/paste response. So I ask again. FINALLY, the rep says.....get ready, are you sitting down?....\n\"As a one-time courtesy, we've issued a $45 refund to your account. Please know I'm always here if you need anything!\" \n.......My followup responses go unanswered. \n\nGOT MY BOX 3 DAYS LATE WITH NO NOTIFICATION: right after this customer service interaction, my box arrives! Yay! It looks like it came from war. Every single thing inside is dented and beat up. Things are melting and gross looking and it was only outside for maybe 20 minutes. But wait!! Are you ready for the best part!!!.......\n\nENTIRE ORDER WAS WRONG: yep! You read that right! The ENTIRE order was wrong! Foods I can't eat, meals I never picked or heard of, ingredients missing, AWESOME!! I'm literally in disbelief looking at it after going through all of this - I thought I would at least have meals. Nope. Okay, I immediately go back to customer service. And I'm not waiting 48 hours. I have no food, am down $105, (they so generously gave me $45!!!) and nobody has helped me. I text them again many times in a row. \n\nSomeone responds 2 hours later:\n\"I've refunded your card $45 as a one-time courtesy\". \nMy followup texts demanding full refund go unanswered.\n\nSUMMARY: As someone who is struggling financially but wanted to treat myself to a nice meal plan to eat healthier and help with my dietary allergies, this was an absolute nightmare. They still owe me the full refund but won't respond. I'm posting this for people like me - or even if you're not! - who think this will make their life easier. It won't, it's not, and somehow they'll still scam you out of money. This was mind-blowingly bad service - actually, I can't even say service - it was a straight up con job. Their customer response strategy is INSANE; no phone number or opportunity to talk with someone live, and 48 hour response times even when you're missing your food. No full refunds, even when absolutely everything is wrong. \nI am a level-headed person (lol even if this doesn't seem like it) who understands delays and mishaps. But this, no communication, no help, no acknowledgment, and being so casual about wronging their customer? I don't understand. \n\nSo please, this is my warning - go with another service instead. Thanks Hungryroot! I can't wait to enjoy my soggy pork loins (I don't eat pork) and 4 bags of broccoli! ",

          "full_text": "I got my first HungryRoot box a couple weeks ago. They texted me the day before saying they had to make a substitution due to running out of ground beef patties. (One of my recipes was hamburgers and they subbed pre-cooked chili lime chicken instead of ground beef patties\u2026? No thanks.) That\u2019s just unacceptable for me\u2026 I chose my recipes 6 days in advance and had no opportunity to select the substitution myself. AND once I got the box, two major ingredients were missing altogether. I complained and was partially refunded, thinking I wouldn\u2019t be trying them again. But plot twist - I actually liked the food, so I decided to give them another try. Maybe it was a fluke.\n\nI was supposed to get my second box yesterday (Saturday), and it is now Sunday evening, and delivery has been rescheduled for tomorrow. Besides some seasonings and some pretzel buns, literally everything else in the box will be spoiled.\n\nJust completely inexcusable issues for a meal delivery service. The entire point is to save time and effort, and twice now I\u2019ve had to restrategize my meal plan for the week, which defeats the entire purpose.\n\nWelp, I\u2019m off to Trader Joe\u2019s\u2026",

If you try to cancel you subscription, they cancel orders you already paid and keep the money.  They will not give you a refund even if you specifically request not to have a delivery that week, so you end up having more points than you can spend.  And of course half of my meals were missing items, for which they gave me money back on their \"wallet\" but again no refund. On top of that, their \"recipes\" are just cook the meat, cook the veggies separately or have a salad with the meat.  You are better off buying the food directly from Publix (yes, I found one of their precooked meats there), Sprouts, Whole Foods or another grocery store.  Do not do business with this company. If you want food delivered, go somewhere... anywhere else.",

Comparatively, HR is terrible. The food quality, the recipes, the way the instructions are printed \u2014 it\u2019s all subpar compared to EveryPlate and Hello Fresh. They send full bags of ingredients for one recipe. Why am I getting a full package of sliced cheese for two cheeseburgers\u2026? They also send other companies\u2019 products. If I wanted Kevin\u2019s pre-cooked chicken, I\u2019d have just gone to Costco. The recipes we\u2019ve had instructed us to maybe heat up a couple things in the microwave and brown the protein in a pan. The other 2 boxed plans send ingredients and you get to ACTUALLY cook (make your own sauces, pickle your own vegetables, etc.). This feels like a huge scam and we\u2019ll both be cancelling. It isn\u2019t worth it for the money. Spend elsewhere.",

I can put most of these meals together in 15 minutes which is awesome. \nI like the option to get groceries but that isn\u2019t mandatory. \n\nI have done factor in the past, which was fine but again underwhelming, and Gobble, which has by far had the best tasting food but lots of prep work and clean up. \nGreenchef, blue apron, hello fresh, similar to gobble. Just more prep work than I want to do on a weeknight after work. \n \nWondering if there is a similar option maybe with more variety or better tasting meals? I feel like I may just have to go back to cooking from scratch on my own.\n",
