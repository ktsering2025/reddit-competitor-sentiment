            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I got the Apple-Cinnamon Focaccia in my box today and I'm confused about the amount of Instant Yeast I'm to use. The menu says in the Ingredients section, there are 2 units of Instant Yeast and the directions say to whisk the flour, yeast, 2 T sugar and 1 T salt together. I got 4 packets of Instant Yeast, with each packet saying they are 7 grams/1 Tablespoon each. So how many packets of Yeast should I use? All the other ingredients indicate an actual amount (the apples say a unit is 2 apples, which I got). I double checked both the online menu in my week and in the Cookbook and they both agree...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Your blatant use of Al is absolutely appalling to me. The recent article in which you brag about how quickly Al can generate meals for you is disturbing.

"Three months. That’s how long it used to take HelloFresh, the world’s largest meal kit company, to move a chef’s creation from kitchen to customer. The recipe itself required just a few hours of culinary artistry. The production process that followed — including editing, photographing, retouching, entering data, and translating cooking steps into foolproof instructions — consumed the rest of that quarter, and it wasn’t even personalized.

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I posted a bag of the florets I got last week and I thought it was a funny ‘gift’ since there was a period of no HF broccoli. But again this week I get another bag of florets and a whole head of broccoli just thrown in my box as is!! It’s not for any of my meals nor is it a replacement for a veggie in my meals. My meals were all correct and missing nothing. Also, to make this a bit worse, I don’t even like broccoli, D’Oh!! </p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I have been using hello fresh 5 meals/week for over a year. I joined for convenience and health reasons, figuring it would be easier to maintain a small calorie deficit or maintaince with preplanned meals and meet my health goals. In no way have I ever been strict about dieting, i lost some weight when starting hello fresh and then plateaued when I started Pilates about 6 months ago. I figured it was just the muscle I was putting on, as I’m 25f around 140lbs. But I got super insecure, because no matter what my stomach was super bloated and swollen most of the time.

I quit hello fresh 3 weeks ...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/ReadyMeals discusses Factor75 in the context of meal kit services.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> What ready meal services deliver best on Fridays and Saturdays? I work over night Sat-Tues, which makes the freshness of the food best if delivered on a Friday night/Saturday morning. I've tried factor and cookunity. Are there any services that can deliver on those days?</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I've been a Factor customer for 6 months. Every week my delivery has come on time: Sunday afternoon, like I scheduled. Today my order simply did not arrive. I know it wasn't shipped to the wrong address because I never received any email confirmation that the game arrived. I called this afternoon to inquire and was told it would be in by 7 PM today. 7 PM comes, I try to call again and it automatically hangs up on me.

Has this happened to anyone else? If so, how frequently? Honestly I think I'm going to have to cancel my subscription because I can't afford for this to happen again. I need to k...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I tried factor since I had a discount from my credit card holder, food was ass but now I’m unable to cancel - while I was able to “deactivate” my subscription it says I still have to pay for the next two weeks of deliveries? I understand that the orders are place a week in advance but this seems a bit absurd. </p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customer dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> My box got delivered to the completely wrong apartment complex this week. I'm not talking about the one that's across the street or a different building in my complex, because I understand that my apartment complex has an address that's very similar to the one across the street. Sometimes I have to walk across the street it's not really that big a deal. It sucks, but I deal.

The box was dropped off and the photo was so close to the box I couldn't even see where it was placed, but in the top left corner there were GPS coordinates. I called Factor customer service and I told them hey here are t...</p>
