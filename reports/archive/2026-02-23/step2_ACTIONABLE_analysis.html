            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh discusses HelloFresh in the context of meal kit services.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Some people have complained about the expanded number of menu choices.  I don't like seeing the same meals that I will never order over and over again.  One way that Hello Fresh could address these issues is to allow us to hide meals so we will never see them again.  

It should be possible to view and unhide hidden meals, and for a given week it should be possible to see which hidden meals are available.

It's possible that Hello Fresh intends to address this issue with AI, but I prefer more control over the meals offered to me, and the option to hide meals would be very useful to me.

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh discusses HelloFresh in the context of meal kit services.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I know HelloFresh staff has a presence in this subreddit, so I thought I'd post a suggestion, since I'm not seeing a place on their website for this kind of thing. 

Plastic waste is still a big issue for meal kits, and I thought it might help a bit if users were able to select which spice packets for recipes they want included in the box. For example, I always have plenty of things like garlic powder or crushed red pepper on hand. If there was a spot I could opt-out of having those packets sent to me, I would do so.</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I am regularly receiving letters packaged in a way to look like legit mail, just to find hello fresh  offers in the envelope, and it feels like every app I use somehow finds a way to throw hello fresh in my face. It is way too aggressive, and for this reason, nothing could ever convince me to use hello fresh.

  
That's all.</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> For the past several months, I've noticed a major decrease in Quality Assurance with HF meals. Our weekly box regularly arrives without ingredient cards, without ingredients, without some meals(!), with moldy vegetables, late, etc. When it was every once in a while I could handle it because I only had to contact support a couple of times a year. But since the new year, I have had to contact support 6 times. I told myself that if our next box arrived with any issues, I would cancel. Well what do you know, opened up our box for this week and immediately saw only 3 out of the 4 meals that we orde...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Hi, I recently received my first order of 3 meals from Hello Fresh. Mine arrived well packaged, on time and with nice fresh-seeming food. Do they send their best on first orders? I'm reading so much here about people getting incomplete and late orders or rotten food...were they trying to make a good first impression or did I get lucky?

Saturday, my elderly mother and I made the Crispy-Skin Salmon & Thai Chili Slaw. It took us about 45 minutes to make because we are disorganized and my mom has a little dementia. We got 3 portions out of the meal and both enjoyed it. My mom said she wasn't eati...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> So I just finished my first order of Fuel Meals, and let me just say… This shit was absolutely vile.

This is the fourth nationwide, frozen, ship-to-your-door ready meal company I’ve tried, and I’m pretty sure it’s my last. At this point I genuinely believe that meals shipped nationwide and frozen are just never going to taste fresh or high quality. It’s not even about the brand anymore, it’s honestly just the business model. You can’t deep-freeze food, ship it across the country, microwave it, and expect it to taste like something freshly made.

My recent Fuel Meals order was honestly disgust...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Earlier this week I Found a sharp jagged large piece of hard black plastic in my factor meal after I had taken several bites. I reached out to factor on 3 separate occasions and still can’t get anyone to call me back.   I am so worried someone might get seriously hurt.  I have posted on Facebook and instagram but I need this info to spread far and fast!!</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Okay hear me out. I canceled Factor because my deliveries kept arriving super late (like 11pm–12am), one box was delivered to a completely different street and I had to go track it down, and several meals arrived damaged (they did compensate me, though).

Now I’m considering signing back up. I’ve seen people here recommend CookUnity, but the meals that appeal to me there look bigger and higher calorie. I’m on a GLP-1 and only eat one meal a day — I can barely finish a full Factor meal as it is (usually about 80%). I don’t love leftovers and I hate wasting food, so portion size matters.

For th...</p>
