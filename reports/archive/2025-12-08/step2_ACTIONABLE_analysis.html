            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Everyone is losing their minds analyzing pixels on recipe cards to see if a robot drew a bell pepper. It’s madness. It’s a waste of energy. Let’s ask Katie about stuff that matters. The life-changing stuff.

Katie, welcome to the sub. I have a very serious question for you: What is your personal stance on the HelloFresh garlic cloves?

I’m talking about the ones that are the size of a singular Tic Tac. The ones that look like they were grown in a bonsai garden for hamsters. Where does HelloFresh even find garlic this small? Is there a special farm where they stop the growing process at "embryo...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh discusses HelloFresh with positive recommendations and customer satisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I love HF soups and added this one to my cart without checking it out so I was surprised when I found out I had to make the noodles, a big D’Oh moment! 

So as you can see my noodles were a bit too thick and big. The rest of the soup tasted great though but I wouldn’t get this again as it wasn’t worth the effort. I thought I had some Parker house rolls but had this cornbread instead. I highly recommend getting the HF cornbreads, they’re soo good! 

My fav chicken soup from HF has been the Dilly Chicken & Pearl Pasta soup, I hope to see that one again. If it comes back, definitely give that one...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Apologies for yet another post on the subject. I just felt this was warranted. Look, I love the Hello Fresh subscription I have and I'm only invested in the wellbeing of that service for personal reasons, so I see AI-based enshittification as a bit of a threat to that. 

The CEO proudly states this quote in speaking with a journalist at Forbes [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenwunker/2025/11/06/hellofreshs-recipe-revolution-why-ai-personalization-meant-redesign/)

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Decided to cancel after reading the Forbes article. It took seconds. Go to account settings, then plan settings there is an option to skip or cancel.

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> A few weeks ago we ordered a meal with garlic bread and received garlic butter. This week we ordered the Caesar salad and focaccia meal and only received 2 meals and a loose package of pork lumpia and chicken sausage dumplings. We are pescatarian. HF has really been slipping since the price increase and it makes me sad because this really saves me time and mental space trying to create decent veggie forward emails. Has anyone else noticed this?</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Ordered one of their “free” boxes with a second box at a discount via my roommates promo cards. On my first one, I only got the microwaveable ones. I had 2 salads and some smoothie/matcha thing in there for their “6” items. So I got 3 items, when it was supposed to be 6. 

I also had  to call them 3 times because they charged me 95 bucks for the promo. And I have to call them again. And then again. By this time, they did refund everything except shipping costs for half of my order.

I call them again today because I have another charge on my card and tell them just to F off and cancel it, beca...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> First week trying Factor meal delivery service, and they dump the box with 10 meals at 1:40am outside my office building in a downtown metro area filled with transients. Someone stole them and had a free feast. Thankfully, I received a full refund and cancelled my subscription permanently. Such a disappointing experience. If anyone has had a great experience with other meal delivery services please let me know. </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Anyone else having problems with Factor. We have had broken meals 2 weeks in a row. 1st week refund for broken meal. This week it was burger with onions on the outside of another meal.  It was warm and smelly. I was refunded for 1 and told to wipe the other down. No cross contamination. The smell alone made my stomach roll. </p>
