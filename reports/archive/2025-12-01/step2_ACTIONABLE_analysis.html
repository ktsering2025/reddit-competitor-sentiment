            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> As someone who is limited in their resources for food, I'm continuing to use Hello Fresh, but it's getting ridiculous. I saw this listing for January 7th. This is the worst AI generated photo I've seen since they rolled it out! I also noticed that HF is forcing me to choose a 3rd meal for that week when I've always ordered 2. It won't even let me add on my free item for that week without making me select a 3rd meal. I'm not sure what I'm going to do at this point. This feels like the end of me subscribing to them.</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> \[throwaway account for obvious reasons\]

We've been customers for years, but for the third time in the last couple of months our weekly HF box has come with a religious tract in it. You know, those little leaflets telling you the solution to natural disasters and mental health issues is to watch Fox News and make a "love offering" to the scamvangelist organization behind the tracts.

We get enough of this Christian nonsense crammed down our throats by the government, I'll be damned if I'm paying for it to be delivered with my groceries.

They're always stuck in on top with the recipe cards, ...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I work full-time on the holidays and wanted to make Thanksgiving special without spending hours shopping and cooking, so I ordered HelloFresh’s Thanksgiving box well in advance. The ingredients were supposed to arrive Tuesday. Tuesday night I got an email saying, “slight delay, don’t worry, it’ll be there Wednesday.” Wednesday came and went and nothing. No box, no updated tracking, no way to actually speak to the courier (the tracking page just loops you back to HelloFresh support).

Hello Fresh support kept telling me it would be there.   It never showed up.  The courier that delivers for the...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I’m in SE PA, I’ve subscribed to Factor and Marley Spoon in the past, I just switched to CookUnity. I received my first order today, and had my first dinner tonight. 

My observations: 
From the label, it looks like my meals were prepared in NY (about 2-2.5 hrs away). They were delivered just before 4pm today, the meals were cold and the icepacks were still frozen.

Much less packaging than Marley Spoon or Factor! My order arrived in a reusable insulated tote with instructions to leave the tote and the ice packs(!) out to be picked up on my next delivery day. 

My meal tonight was skirt steak ...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I had tried Factor and then discontinued it. They made me a pretty good deal to give it another try, so I am currently trying the “New Factor”.

Well, it’s really not much different, maybe a little bit improved, but I cooked this for lunch today and I was absolutely astonished. Broccoli, sweet broccoli, as far as the eye can see!</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I switched from Factor to Cook Unity this week and I’m … not impressed? Am I missing something about why it seems everyone on this subreddit hates factor but loves Cook Unity? I felt like the Factor meals tasted better and had more flavor. 

The taco bowl with quinoa and black beans was inedible due to being extremely salty. The garlic herb chicken with carrot thyme purée was okay, I liked the vegetables the most. I’m eating the pesto chicken bowl and it’s edible. 

 Am I missing something yall? </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Last week we got the meals a day late and all the meat was 60°F so we had to throw it away. Just got the notification the meals are late, again.

We were getting them like 4 months ago with no problems. They used to put 2 or 3 ice packs in the box, now just 1 in the middle.

Last factor box for us, for sure.</p>
