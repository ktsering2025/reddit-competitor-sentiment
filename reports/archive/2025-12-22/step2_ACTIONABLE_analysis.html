            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I used the pictures as a guide for what to expect. Now with the new AI generated photos I am completely thrown off. This recipe, the tangerines look like sweet potatoes and the chicken looks like chicken meatballs instead of diced chicken breast and worms instead of onions. I also can't use the final picture to compare to what I made since it's fake. Not sure if this is allowed here but just wanted to vent the frustration of taking away the real photos.  Been using hello fresh for years and this new AI update has downgraded the quality of the recipes. </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Tomatoes that go from sliced crosswise (and still don’t match the description of what the directions say to do) in one picture to grape tomatoes cut in half on the next step. Bonus of plastic worm looking bell peppers and shallots in step 5.

If anyone from HelloFresh who had anything to do with this is monitoring this subreddit, fire yourself. </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> So this is from Dutch Hellofresh. It's gnocchi with pumpkin sauce with sage brown butter, crispy sage, white cheese, hazelnuts and cranberries.

It was so tasty! </p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> The consumer watchdog is suing home meal delivery providers HelloFresh and Youfoodz for allegedly misleading consumers, claiming the companies used what's known as a "subscription trap".

The ACCC claims the high-profile meal services broke consumer law by telling customers they could easily cancel subscriptions via online accounts when this wasn’t the case. 

Instead, consumers who tried to cancel before the first delivery cut-off time were still charged and could only cancel if they spoke with a customer service representative. 

The consumer watchdog has launched two proceedings in the Fede...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> So im curious if it's just me or not. Have been doing hf for a while now but noticed about a month ago that all the protein items are no longer tightly vacuum sealed. Before they were always tightly sealed with little room for movement but then about a month ago I noticed they all are now arriving only sealed about 1/4" from the edge instead of mostly sealed as close to the meat as possible, so its mostly just a floppy pouch of plastic filled with liquid and a little meat and at least 1 (often times more like half or more) package there will be lines running through where it was sealed as if i...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh highlighting operational or quality issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I’ve had over 100 HF boxes delivered and have never had an issue with delivery. This week I got my regular “out for delivery” text and then very shortly after, and well before my usual delivery time I got a text saying “we couldn’t deliver your box, we’ll try again tmrw”. The next day I didn’t hear a thing about it. That night I messaged HF and they tried to tell me it was still on the way and the food is good for 24 hours after the scheduled delivery. I told them it was already 36 hours after and with our unseasonably warm temps I was skeptical the food would still be good. They did credit me...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I want to get my dad a factor gift card for xmas, but I keep seeing older posts on here that unless you use the whole gift card in a week, you forfeit the rest? Is that still the case? Like if I buy him a $150 gift card and he only uses $80, the rest of that money is down the drain?? I know I could just get him cash, but something about a gift card feels more thoughtful for Christmas. My dad loves factor and has used it for months, so I think he would really appreciate this/ </p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customer dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> So I am absolutely out on Factor. I opened the chicken for my salad this afternoon (12/18) from a box i received (12/16) note: box went straight to refrigerator when delivered.

Customer support fought me for over an hour on refunding me for the whole order after sending them the picture ….because who is eating anything from them after seeing that… not to mention the bug someone posted earlier on this page

Not to ruin Factor for you but just be aware people.</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Factor, I love the food … but I HATE the delivery service. There is drama every week. Every single week. It’s Sunday. And there’s no delivery. Again. The chat agent is broken and not working via Safari or Chrome, so I can’t even speak with someone to find out if my meals are coming. I normally get a text message to say my meals are out for delivery but I did not receive a message today, nor did I receive my delivery today. So are my meals going to be delivered? Or not? I go to bed at 8PM because I get up very early for work. Given we ordered meals, we didn’t go food shopping for the week. So i...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/mealkits expresses concerns about Factor75 with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> We were notified that our order was almost there then I received an email. Keep in mind this was last minute with no time for us to accommodate. The email said the issue was with the “logistics carrier”. 

Then when I chatted with a representative, they said the issue was at “the facility”. 

When I pointed out the discrepancy, he acknowledged it and swears it won’t happen again.

I’m not saying not to use cookunity. I’m just saying beware. We’ve used services lime hellofresh and factor in the past and this NEVER happened. If the food wasn’t just better at Cookunity, i would’ve likely cancelle...</p>
