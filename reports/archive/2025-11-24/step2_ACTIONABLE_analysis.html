            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I am going to do a week's worth of meals and share with you guys what I thought of it all, but so far we are two nights in and it has been nothing less than splendid.

Really excited to share the meals we've made! Thanks hello fresh.

This is going to make my life so much easier. No need to be cooking the same meals every week, the nutritional information, the ingredients, the packaging and delivery. For my first order, 100%. Spot on! </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> What a mistake I made this week! I wasn't paying attention and accidentally ordered THREE meals that all call for broccoli- and every single one of them came with green beans! I've had a few items swapped out over my seven years of HF, but not once have I encountered this. Hello Fresh- if you are going to swap please pay attention to the recipe and pick something that works- zucchini, carrots, peas, etc.. At least be considerate!

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> For context, this meal is the Meatballs with Creamy Onion Gravy. And I got two packets of sour cream. In step one it says to use half of the sour cream in the mashed potatoes, but there is NO other mention of the sour cream in later steps. I genuinely thought I was going crazy. I even had ChatGPT scan it for me because I really thought I was missing something, and it confirmed there was no other mention. I’ve used HelloFresh for three years tomorrow and I’ve genuinely never had this happen to me. I’ve had times where I thought it happened but after a few minutes I caught the “use the rest of t...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> There's nothing but negative reviews on here, and posts about declining quality. All my friends have called their subscriptions, and the hello fresh warehouse here in Georgia closed down. How long can hello fresh go if everyone thats using it seems to hate it and cancels?</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Feeling kind of turned off by the process. One of the reasons I ordered hello freshness because my husband did all the cooking, and he passed away. I'm trying to learn how to cook some new dishes so I don't keep eating the same thing every night. Changing the ingredients on me messed me up because I don't know if I'm supposed to cook it the same way or switch. Plus, frankly, I ordered three other meals with green beans I didn't want green beans with this one.

My question to you guys is this a regular occurrence? Do they like to substitute things? Are your boxes off and late should I change th...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I work in healthcare. Often getting home between 8-10PM and the last thing I want to do is cook. 

Money wise I’d prefer not to spend over $10 a meal. I’ve seen factor before and it seems like it’s good but expensive. 

Any alternatives or suggestions? </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> 66 orders in and the last 10 or so have been terrible. There has been a notable change the last 3 months or so for me… my boxes are often delivered an entire day late (and through door dash?); some boxes have holes in them, exposing the food; and lastly the app is TERRIBLE. Whenever I select my meals, it auto defaults back to the pre-selected ones! 

I canceled my membership and just asked for a refund for my box that came late today with completely melted ice packs and warm food.

I really, really liked this service and relied on it as a crazy busy person with 0 interest in grocery shopping a...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> This company has a deceptive website.

I had a previous subscription which was on hold. I was just browsing meals on the Factor site.  The next thing that happened Factor charged my bank account for a weeks' worth of meals without my consent. Foolish me, this is the 2nd time this has happened. This is a scam that this company does on a regular basis.  I ask the community out there, if there is a class action lawsuit, please let me know.</p>
