            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Hellofresh delivered my box a day early. I did not get a notification it would arrive early and wasn't expecting it. I intentionally chose Monday, as I knew I'd be home from work that morning. I assume this is a wasted box due to me being in Florida. It says it was delivered Monday the 26th, but it's definitely Sunday the 25th.</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I’ve used this service for many years now. It really helped provide a crutch to me when cooking felt unapproachable. But with the AI recipe photos and generated instructions, paying for this service is just insulting at this point after sticking through quality  control and supply issues at times. I do not want to pay to be a guinea pig when there used to be real experts working on this service for us.

Folks in my life have made fun of me. I’m embarrassed it took me this long to cancel, but I encourage anyone on the fence to go for it.

After all of the experience cooking with hello fresh, gr...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Ordered the turkey stuffed bell peppers and this was one of the bell peppers received. I’ve noticed quality has been declining. We’ve received Hello Fresh for 4 years now and the past 6 months has consisted of recipes cards missing, entire meals being incorrect, ingredients going bad in the box, and now produce too small to even properly make the meal. I guess we get the idea of a bell pepper dinner…</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> 
Okay, so I've noticed a change in quality in my Hello Fresh meals since they switched to the cheaper shipping containers. I've had many issues with their ingredients (rotten upon arrival/missing entire meals/sending the wrong meal/having crushed ingredients). Each time I would report the concern through the app and they would say that they refunded me for the meal or the missing ingredients, so I didn't mind too much. 

Fast forward to a week ago where my mom, who also uses hello fresh told me that she noticed that HF never refunded her when they said they would since her box never arrive. Th...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I am so frustrated!!! I signed up for the factor meals because my friend gets them and they always looked so good. My first box arrived with no issues, and the food was delicious!! I was excited about my 2nd box. 

So roll to this past Monday. Box marked delivered in my factor app. I get home, it’s not there. My first thought is that someone stole it. But I got looking and no one ever came by my house to drop anything off. I contacted the shipping company and they informed me that Factor cancelled my order the Friday prior. 

I was never notified of a cancellation. I checked my bank account, a...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I've seen similar questions on here, but all of them have been slightly off the mark from my specific situation. 

Last night, I got an email from Factor saying my delivery was canceled, due to potentially unsafe food conditions. This morning, they added the credits from the order to my account. 

However, ten minutes ago, my order was delivered, despite multiple emails saying it wouldn't arrive.

The ice packs are still frozen solid, although the frozen part of them seem easier to break, and the cardboard on each meal feels somewhat cold. I should also mention that it's been below freezing ou...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customer dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> My 12+ meal order was slated for Monday delivery.  Today's tracking shows my order is slated for a Wednesday delivery.  I understand there's a massive winter storm wrecking delivery logistics, but I'm not eating spoiled food or meals beyond their expiration date.  

I tried chatting with support today, but there was no response from Factor after 6+ minutes.  I'm not in the mood to try calling.  I'll try chatting again tomorrow, will continue with screenshots, and will most likely need to execute a charge back via my card provider.

Have any of you tried anything different?  </p>
