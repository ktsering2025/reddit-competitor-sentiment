            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> As I browse through Hello Fresh, Blue Apron, and other options, I realize I get frustrated with how they charge for 2 servings when I’m only ordering for myself and I wonder if there’s any that cater to 1? Haha 😭</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> this was really good! I added extra seasoning to the chicken as usual because Hellofresh always says just salt and pepper. I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning which I think really helped bring out flavors. Otherwise I think this would lean a bit too heavily on the sauce</p>

Copied my transaction data to chatGPT and had it make a table/chart of my deals/orders of time. I did not really do anything tricky here aside from just ordering from one or the other when deals were mailed/sent to me. 

So many people think its really expensive, but its fairly easy to use a service like this and get the benefits every few weeks/when you need and save some $ too.</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Okay, I know this subject has been discussed over and over again...sorry...

  
I have been using Hello Fresh for about 4 years.  I really enjoy it, and I've had lots and lots of really good food.  I honestly have zero complaints other than....those damn potato wedges!

My boys (14 year old twins) and I love all the sandwiches- fish, mushroom, burger, etc.  And ALL of them come with potato wedges.  I didn't like the potatoes the first time I got them.  By the 10th time I was starting to loathe them, and by now- these dang potato wedges are the bane of my existence!  (Okay, that was totally dra...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Before I start this off, yes I know that most meal prep are not exactly cheap, and I should be focusing on actually buying crucial ingredients, however at this time due to certain restraints as well as dealing with financial woe, as well as not having to use takeout daily, I'd like to opt for a better options once I've gotten into independence, as well as use it for my credit stuffs at the same time.

Now that done, here's my scenario - I am currently working 2 jobs both the week and weekend and I plan on eating two or three meals each days - I also am looking for something that can sustain 15...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh highlighting operational or quality issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> We're having friends over for dinner, so I bought 2x of a kit. Received the fish in the bottom of the box, but not the meal kits! Thankfully got the directions too and ordered a grocery delivery of the missing ingredients. HF refunded me for the full meals, but still weird. Been ordering weekly for the last 2 months since having some temporary mobility issues.

Is this kind of goof normal? This is only my 6th box. First box had canned corn instead of canned black beans ($2.10 credit). </p>

            <p><strong>Engagement:</strong> 24 | <strong>Subreddit:</strong> r/factor75</p>
            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/factor75 expresses concerns about Factor75 with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I'm going into the app on my phone and hitting the cancel button in plan settings. It does a spin load animation and then nothing. It is still showing that I can select meals and the number of meals I'm getting under plan settings. If I can't get rid of this subscription I'm cancelling my debit card.  I don't know what to do. </p>

I'll keep the post short since I'm still on call with Factor customer service because I was charged for the box first, given a total receipt for the full price of only the box, then also charged for the premium meals.

Spooky right? But let's look a little further.
