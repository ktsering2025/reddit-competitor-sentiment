            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> There was another post on this subreddit a while ago about how the noodles never seem to be in the same colour as the recipe card. I also experience this from time to time, but on that specific noodle post the comment section “blamed” OP. 

This is my rice today. It’s white, because I was just supposed to cook it. No biggie, but also… Kinda deceptive? Honestly I’m not reading the whole recipe before I select a dish on the app, so isn’t it fair that I expected the rice to be seasoned, looking at the picture?</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> So, I just got an email from HF saying that I now have a credit of 8€ for Add-ons. Cool...except a large majority of the add-ons are "sold out"! Some of these have been sold out since November. Here in Germany, I have never seen the offers for "free X for life" or free anything to be honest, just these occasional credits, and if HF doesn't have anything for customers to use this credit on, they don't lose money, right?🙄</p>

Hello Fresh sent me an extra meal by mistake but with no protein.  I would like to make the meal I just need the recipe. I have looked in the app can't find it and this isn't a meal we had before. Thanks!!!</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Hello, I just received my 2nd box and I can't tell if it's wrong or not. My profile selection says 4 servings, 3 meals per week. When I looked at this week's delivery it says "4 servings in Box" for each meal, yet it appears that I paid for 9 meals/week, and I received smaller portions of the meat. 

I can't tell if I have something in my settings wrong, our if HF is getting it wrong. All the other ingredients seem to be doubled, except for the best. Anyone have ideas?</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I was a dedicated hello fresh user for 6 years at this point. Loved it, was getting it delivered by UPS or FedEx


I took a break for 6 months. I signed up again- to find out that they’re now using Dashlink (DoorDash) to deliver boxes. 

I’ve only gotten 6 boxes and 3 of them were not delivered.

The first one, the driver supposedly said it was undeliverable- which is not true becuase I literally get door dash all the time- Dashlink said it was going back to the center. I contacted hello fresh and they told me that actually it was going to be redelivered that day. Guess what? No one came to re...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I canceled hello fresh after many years of using them. As many others have recently. Numerous reasons, too many to list at the moment.

But I got this ad and I think it's funny that it says "breakfast for life" with a side note of *4 weeks. 

Hello fresh, you really have become the worst. AI slop and just plain lies. The hell. </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> After being a customer of Hello Fresh I decided to try Factor to save some time cooking during a busy school season. The meals are just ok and are very small portions. To be honest I would generally eat the meat side of the dish as the vegetables sucked. Be aware of the price you are paying..4 meals averaged $18 a piece with shipping and it's simply not worth it. The final straw was that during New Year's holiday I decided to skip a week. When I did this window popped up and gave me a link to an offer that if I unskipped it I would have that week for 50% off. So I did. It did not automatically...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> The screenshots show it all, but basically I received an offer in the mail and scanned the QR code. Logged into my old account to see how much box would be with the deal. I checked out the meals and decided that I didn’t want to place an order. Multiple hours later I got a notification that factor charged me $50. I never placed an order, never unpaused my subscription, and they will not issue a refund. I don’t understand how this is like.. legal? Normally wouldn’t be a big deal because I’ve enjoyed Factor in the past (it’s been 2 years), but I’m severely hurting financially right now.

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Hi!

I’m from Nh and I enjoy Hellofresh- I usually cook them all on the weekend and reheat, but I’ve been very busy. Also the new Dashlink deliver service absolutely sucks and I’ve had 3 missing packages in 2 months 

I’m looking into factor and cook unity

Anyone have experience with those? I know cook unity depends on your area often. </p>
