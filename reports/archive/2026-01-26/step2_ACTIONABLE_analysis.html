            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I just want to say that I love this service. I don't have to search busy stores for the things I need. The meat is way fresher than the grocery store and tastes juicer and fresher. Each recipe is unique in its own way giving a vast amount of ethnic influences to my diet. I have also lost 20 lbs in 1 year just from eating healthier. I highly recommend it. I love the mushroom Risotto this is a good as the 5 star Italian restaurants. The chicken Milanese is my second fav so far. Most of the time I do the port taquitos or the chicken and Couscous since it low calorie. The chicken green pepper sand...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I know there's lots of buzz about using ML (machine learning, not to be confused with AI) for auto selecting recipes for each week, but I'm gonna be honest with you: First thing I do is go in and unselect all of them. Because, well, they're probably not the best. And if I'm going to spend an hour cooking these meals, I'm gonna spend the extra few minutes making sure I'm cooking something I prefer. 

Yeah, let's also accept - there's probably a better profit margin on the stuff you auto-select, I get it. Go capitalism. I shudder to think if a slide repeated across internal decks celebrates this...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Hello all, Been a long time lurker reading post and decided to post to ask for help. 

I've been using hello fresh for a year and half. Its been rather good no major complaints. Just with my current life situation. I'm looking for something that is a little more convenient and quick but while still being healthy. I find hello fresh to be a bit of work sometimes. Taking up to an hour then not counting clean up and there is no dishwasher in this house. 

I'm currently living with Grandma and uncle.  just between looking out for them, taking care of this house and cleaning up messes they make. I'...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Michael Scott’s Fun Run Alfredo. Quick and easy to make and I appreciate The Office reference. 

Pork Meatball Mushroom Soup. I never made pork meat balls or burgers until I used HelloFresh. The broth was savory and a perfect seasonal soup. 

Prosciutto Wrapped Apricot Chicken. I’m glad the prosciutto meals weren’t an upcharge. The apricot sauce was my favorite part of this dish. 

Smothered Chicken with Bacon Gravy. This one was one of my favorite sauces. The bacon gravy with the chicken was delicious. Kept the chicken juicy and the leftover sauce was great on the mashed potatoes. </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Like the title says, I got a great email promo and decided to give hello fresh another try. First box came in today, and it’s missing my third recipe. 

Not to mention I ordered one of my favorite recipes, the bee sting hot honey pizza, and the dough portion is NOTICEABLY smaller. The dough ball used to be much larger and fill out my entire pan, but this one is tiny and very thin once laid out. I last had this recipe in November, so it hasn’t exactly been very long. Total shrinkflation. 

This is ridiculous, and I’m probably going to cancel again. What a pathetic QC process, how is it that the...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> My wife and I are obese. We both have high cholesterol. Diabetes (type 2) runs in my family and my wife’s family. We eat out so much that I’m embarrassed to admit how much we spend on it each month. We both have ADHD and depression and struggle to cook each day after working full time. 

I want meals that won’t make my nutritionist disappointed in me like I already am in myself. We aren’t super picky, no major allergies. 

From other posts here I decided against Factor 75 and a couple other major brands. I heard Clean Eatz Kitchen is okay in terms of nutrition and cost, is that a good starting...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> “I HEAR YOU!” 

No, Factor, you do not. +$13.99 per piddly salad is insane. We only had one discount on our account (military veteran), and after weeks of no surcharge for salads, suddenly a quiet change to $14 for EACH salad (where I don’t even want the chicken anyway) is just beyond slimy. I stood up for you Factor, but this kind of move is some bullshit. </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> My package has been delayed two days. I have asked for a refund because I think that’s gross it’s not refrigerated and only has an ice pack that may fail and then I’m supposed to eat 3 day food that was not in the fridge

They tried to tell me on their end is says arrived, so I so I have a time marked screenshot from Canada post is has not arrived. I’m looking for a refund

They say they can refund me $9 instead of the full price of $65 (first and last time ordering)

I said that’s not what I want…. I asked if it arrives tomorrow and the food isn’t cold do I get a refund?

They said it’s not t...</p>
