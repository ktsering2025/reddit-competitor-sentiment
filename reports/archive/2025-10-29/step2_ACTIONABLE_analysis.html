            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh discusses HelloFresh in the context of meal kit services.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I've been with Hello Fresh for a while now, and whilst I'm not a full blown vegetarian, I do try to limit meat to once a week.
As we all know, the HF veggie options can be few and far between. 
Is it worth staying with Hello Fresh (we get 5 - 2 person meals a week) or should I look into something like Hungry Root?

It really comes down to convenience at this point. I don't want to go back to the headache of meal planning and grocery shopping.</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Ever  since the AWS Amazon cloud server outage, the hello fresh (canada for me) website has not been working. Their headers and links ar the bottom of the page loaded, but the rest was a white screen.

I cleared my cookies and cache and closed the site. Now it takes me to a login screen, but I can't log in. I have always used the login with Google button, but that is no longer an option. I tried clicking forgot my password but that doesn't work. 

The links at the top of the page: Our plans, how it works and our recipes don't work.

My app still works thank goodness, but it doesn't have nearly...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> This has been an ongoing issue over the years, but I select and SAVE meal selections, then when they are being shipped to me they are completely different meals. Whenever I have called, the representative insists that it's a user error, but I know it is not. I know how to work an app and select and hit save. This has happened a handful of times and I finally cancelled for good. Has anyone else experienced this? </p>

And I thought Factor was bad at 800mg!! </p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I'm looking for a pre-made meal service that is like Factor 75 with healthier choices (high protein, low carb, low calorie) but not Factor 75. Or CookUnity. Or Hungryroot.

I liked Factor at first but I kept getting the same 5 meals and the portion/quality changed. Missing ingredients (like no cheese in cauliflower mac n cheese) and everything was broccoli. Like...everything. And it was one stalk of broccoli. But I liked that the calories were in range, it was gluten free and low carb. 

I tried cook unity and I hate it. It's too much salt and everything is so high in calorie content. I found ...</p>
