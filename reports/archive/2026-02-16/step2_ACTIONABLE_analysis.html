            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/mealkits discusses HelloFresh in the context of meal kit services.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Are there any meal kits that don’t use AI for their recipes? I used Hello Fresh for a year and liked it for the convenience but now they have so many choices it doesn’t really save me time and their recipes have become more confusing. I learned that they are relying heavily on AI and I would prefer something with fewer choices that has been tested by an actual human. Does thus exist or is it time for me to dust off my cook books?</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Hi everyone! We’re working on a new feature in the HelloFresh app called The Cookbook, and we’d love for this community to help us beta-test it.

**What is it?** It’s a tool that helps you take control of your recipe planning. You can grab a link from social media, a blog, or anywhere online and the app converts chaotic videos or long posts into a clear step-by-step recipe all stored in one place.

**The best part:** It’s completely free. If you already have a HelloFresh subscription and the app, great! And if you don’t, no subscription is needed. If you’ve ever saved or bookmarked recipes fro...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Finally hopped onto my computer and canceled my subscription last week. It took me less than 5 minutes to fully cancel and I made sure to put in my reasons as to why I was leaving

A) inconsistency with quality and quantities

B) implementing AI in every way they could instead of paying actual humans

 I would have stayed a loyal customer otherwise. I loved Hello Fresh, but I hated the missing recipe cards, or sometimes 3 of the same card in one box, all of the junk mail that went to waste every week, and the lack of portions. I'm not a big person and I don't have the biggest appetite, but tho...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/hellofresh expresses concerns about HelloFresh with customers considering cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> As much as I love the recipes and the convenience, the missing ingredients and receiving moldy food in every kit is unacceptable. Today I received my box and my pork stir fry didn’t come with pork. Last week every piece of produce in one of my meal was rotten. The chat agents are zero help. So I’m going to cancel my HelloFresh membership.

Has anyone made the switch to a new meal kit? Looking for some suggestions, or if anyone has a free box to another meal kit then can give?</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I've been getting Factor meals (sporadically because I refuse to pay full price & wait for the coupons) for about a year and have rated almost every meal I've tried. Curious if anyone else has ratings/please share if you do!

\*I freeze most of my meals, so that may affect some of the ratings</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> My wife and I decided to try Factor meals out about a month and a half ago. Back in October my wife and I tragically lost our daughter and it has made simple things like trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, going to the grocery store and cooking each night extremely taxing mentally and physically so we thought that having meals delivered to the house we could just put in the microwave would make things a little easier on that front and it did for the first two weeks. After that the last 3 deliveries we have had have been terrible. Each box has had at least 2-3 meals that have had to be...</p>

            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> Apparently they have a strict deadline of Wed 11:59pm WHICH I was never aware of or reminded for in my email. Now I am expecting random meals delivered to my door for next week. 

I have disputed with Amex, also talked with manager at Factor, was willing to give me 50% refund and would not budge otherwise. For the experience I had for one week, I am not giving them more of my money, the food is awful and is not worth this hefty price. 

Manager was quite rude as well (its okay if you disputed with your bank, I have all the info to tell them?) LIKE WHAT - this is the worst customer service I ha...</p>

            <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This post from r/ReadyMeals expresses concerns about Factor75 highlighting operational or quality issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Content:</strong> So we have been getting meal delivery from EatClean since about April of 2025.  It started out pretty good with only the occasional mistake of an incorrect or missing meal which they would quickly credit me for.  The quality of the food was decent too.  Didn't have a lot of fatty sauces like we were getting with Factor and they had multiple categories like Paleo, GLP-1, etc that made it good to follow certain diets.  Fast forward to about November.  They change delivery service from UPS to something else.  I stopped receiving tracking information and meals would arrive days late.  When we had ...</p>
