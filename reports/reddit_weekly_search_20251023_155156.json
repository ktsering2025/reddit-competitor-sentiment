Mais la qualité des produits baisse et le service aussi.  \nCette semaine, ma livraison n’a tout simplement pas eu lieu. Le service client m’explique que Chronopost aurait eu un “problème d’adresse” — alors que mon adresse n’a jamais changé et que toutes les livraisons précédentes ont été faites sans souci.  \nOn convient malgré tout d’une nouvelle livraison le lendemain. Comme je travaillais, j’ai fait venir quelqu’un qui a dû rester bloqué toute la journée chez moi pour attendre la box. Résultat : aucune livraison, aucune alerte, aucun appel.  \nDeux jours perdus, pas un repas livré, et surtout aucun geste commercial.  \nJe réfléchis sérieusement à passer à la concurrence (Quitoque) pour un service plus fiable et respectueux du client. Dommage d’en arriver là, mais la confiance, elle, ne se livre pas deux fois.",

But I liked that the calories were in range, it was gluten free and low carb. \n\nI tried cook unity and I hate it. It's too much salt and everything is so high in calorie content. I found myself spending more time looking for healthy meals and it always came down to the same 3-4 meals as a result. \n\nI signed up for Hungryroot and immediately cancelled it. It's too confusing and I just want a meal plan-not a plan that changes based on the amount of credits attached to the meal I choose. \n\nSo with that info...can anyone suggest a plan that is healthy and moderately low in calories that also leans into gluten free?

On the other hand, you get stuck playing people who are consistently -150 points below you and lose more than twice what you would win. For example, for a win I would get 3-5 points, and for a loss, I would lose 10-12 points. My win rate is not 75% against people who are slightly worse, including factors like disconnecting/flagging. I've attached my stats below. It seems as if either the matchmaking system is overly aggressive on forcing a lower rated opponent after a loss (even after I've aborted 3+ times), I consistently face down. I don't mind this, but what I do mind is the overly disadvantageous odds that I play with every time I play down. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66kyrnl8ywwf1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeb295100f6777790de2c627c197c45253961ebb\n\n",

      "title": "Minnesota Vikings vs. Los Angeles Chargers Score and Prop Bet Picks TNF 10/23/25",
      "selftext": "# Comprehensive NFL Betting Analysis: Minnesota Vikings vs. Los Angeles Chargers (October 23, 2025)\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Thursday Night Football matchup featuring the Minnesota Vikings (3–3) and the Los Angeles Chargers (4–3) on October 23, 2025, at SoFi Stadium draws intrigue from bettors and fans alike. Both teams are battling playoff aspirations amidst inconsistent stretches, and bookmakers have positioned the Chargers as slight favorites at -3.5, with a game total (over/under) set at 44.5 pointss.\n\n# Score Prediction\n\n**Predicted Final Score:**  \n**Los Angeles Chargers 27, Minnesota Vikings 24**\n\nThe score projection anticipates a closely contested, moderately high-scoring game, reflecting both teams’ offensive potential paired with defensive weaknesses. The Chargers’ home field, passing acumen, and favorable matchups for wideouts slightly tilt the outcome in their favor; however, the Vikings' potent passing attack and recent ability to clear modest totals make this a near toss-up—ultimately keeping the score within a field goal.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nRecent data reveal that the Chargers’ offense, led by Justin Herbert, ranks among the league’s most productive passing units (over 273 yards per game), while their defense has hemorrhaged points and struggled especially against the pass. Meanwhile, the Vikings are transitioning under Carson Wentz, who has averaged 268 passing yards per game in his four starts and supported a resurgent Justin Jefferson (nearly 90 receiving yards per game). Both teams have exceeded or threatened the 21-point mark regularly in recent games (Chargers: 21.6 PPG; Vikings: 24.2 PPG), and defensive absences should keep offensive production above-average.\n\n# Best Game Bet\n\n**Bet:**  \n**Minnesota Vikings +3.5 (-115)**\n\n# Betting Angles and Line Analysis\n\nThe Chargers opened as smaller favorites, but steady money on Los Angeles and injury concerns on Minnesota’s offensive line shifted the spread to LAC -3.5. Crucially, most models rate these teams closer to even on neutral ground, making the current line reflect not just home-field advantage but also public sentiment after the Chargers’ offensive fireworks last week. However, the Chargers have underperformed against the spread (2-3-1 ATS), while the Vikings have covered in three of their last five and maintained a 60% ATS record in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vikings have played the Chargers close, going 5-1 ATS in the last six meetings, and their offensive output has been consistent, especially with Wentz at the helm. Given that both teams have flaws—particularly the Chargers’ declining defense, which ranks dead last in yards-per-play allowed over the last three games—the matchup is likelier to remain tight than the spread suggests. The Vikings at +3.5 offers a valuable cushion in what projects as a one-possession game.\n\n# Player Prop Bet Picks\n\n# Top Recommendations\n\n1. **Justin Herbert Over 253.5 Passing Yards (-110)**\n2. **Justin Jefferson Over 75.5 Receiving Yards (-118)**\n3. **Jordan Mason Over 54.5 Rushing Yards (-110)**\n\n# Analysis\n\n**Justin Herbert Over 253.5 Passing Yards**  \nHerbert has averaged 273.3 passing yards per game this season, has cleared the set prop line in five of seven starts, and is coming off a 420-yard performance against Indianapolis. Minnesota employs one of the NFL’s highest blitz rates, but Herbert historically thrives under pressure and when attacked by the blitz. The Vikings have allowed 7.6 yards per attempt in their last three games, ranking near the bottom in that span. With the Chargers likely leaning on the pass due to their unreliable ground game and positive game script, Herbert should have the opportunity to exceed this prop.\n\n**Justin Jefferson Over 75.5 Receiving Yards**  \nJefferson is the target monster in Minnesota’s passing attack, with at least 11 targets in three consecutive games and 324 receiving yards across that stretch. The Chargers have allowed multiple receivers to surpass 75 yards in recent weeks and are particularly vulnerable to elite route runners who can work intermediate and deep areas. Jefferson’s average of almost 90 receiving yards per game this year gives this over a solid statistical foundation, and his ceiling is further elevated against this pass defense.\n\n**Jordan Mason Over 54.5 Rushing Yards**  \nMason has been the workhorse RB for the Vikings with Aaron Jones still questionable. He’s topped this total in three of his last four and faces a Chargers run defense that has recently allowed almost 140 yards per game to opposing backs. Even if Aaron Jones suits up in a limited role, Mason’s recent production and volume make him an attractive over bet.\n\n# Same Game Parlay\n\n**Recommended Parlay:**\n\n1. **Justin Herbert Over 253.5 Passing Yards**\n2. **Justin Jefferson Over 75.5 Receiving Yards**\n3. **Jordan Mason Over 54.5 Rushing Yards**\n4. **Both Teams to Score 15+ Points**\n\n**Approximate Odds:** \\+1100\n\n# Description and Correlation\n\nThis parlay leverages the most consistent offensive performers from each side, all positioned in matchups conducive to overs, and adds a modest game total leg that has occurred in the majority of both teams’ games. The Chargers’ passing volume, Jefferson’s target share, and Mason’s opportunities against a leaky run defense each have individual statistical support from recent trends and matchup analytics.\n\nBoth teams scoring 15 or more points is a conservative threshold—Minnesota has achieved this in all Wentz starts and the Chargers have only failed to reach that mark once. Such a combination offers correlation value, as high passing and rushing yardage from the “stars” aligns with a competitive, higher-scoring script.\n\n# In-Depth Analytical Discussion and Context\n\n# Recent Performance and Trends\n\n# Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe Vikings, under Kevin O’Connell, have maintained offensive efficiency despite quarterback musical chairs. Carson Wentz has injected stability, averaging 268 yards per start and supporting healthy production for his receivers—especially Justin Jefferson (528 yards on 34 catches this season). Minnesota’s offensive line is banged up, but Wentz utilizes quick passes, and the Vikings have leaned on Mason (4.5 yards per carry) to maintain down-and-distance fluidity.\n\nDefensively, the Vikings are aggressive under Brian Flores (top-2 blitz rate), which increases volatility—capable of producing sacks and turnovers but also exposing the secondary to big plays if the rush misses home.\n\n# Los Angeles Chargers\n\nThe Chargers possess a dynamic passing attack but a defensively regressing unit. Herbert’s league-leading 1,913 passing yards and high completion percentage (67.5%) are complemented by a growing group of receivers: Keenan Allen, Quentin Johnston, and slot maven Ladd McConkey. However, the run game is a liability (111.1 rush YPG, 16th), now exacerbated by injuries to backup RBs, shifting more weight on Herbert’s right arm.\n\nDefensively, Coach Harbaugh’s squad has failed to generate consistent stops, yielding over 23 points and 330+ yards per game. The coverage units in particular have been outflanked, representing a clear path for Minnesota to attack.\n\n# Injury Reports and Player Availability\n\nBoth teams face key injuries, but the core playmakers remain intact.\n\n# Vikings (Key Statuses from 10/22/25)\n\n* **OUT:** OLB Andrew Van Ginkel (neck), FB C.J. Ham (hand)\n* **Questionable:** OT Christian Darrisaw (knee), RB Aaron Jones (hamstring), QB J.J. McCarthy (ankle), OT Brian O'Neill (knee), RB Zavier Scott (wrist)\n* **Active/Probable:** Carson Wentz (shoulder, full), Justin Jefferson, Jordan Mason, Jordan Addison\n\nMinnesota is short-handed at linebacker and possibly on the offensive line, but key skill players and disruptors (Wilson, Pace, Metellus) are active.\n\n# Chargers (Key Statuses from 10/22/25)\n\n* **OUT:** RB Hassan Haskins (hamstring)\n* **Questionable:** OT Joe Alt (ankle), OT Trey Pipkins (knee), G Jamaree Salyer (knee), DB Elijah Molden (thumb)\n* **Active/Probable:** Herbert, Allen, McConkey\n\nThe impact is most acute at offensive tackle, potentially keeping the Vikings’ blitz packages effective. With backup RBs out, the pass volume for Herbert should remain high.\n\n# Betting Market Insights and Public Action\n\n# Line Movement\n\n* **Opener:** Chargers -2.5 / Total 43.5\n* **Current:** Chargers -3.5 / Total 44.5\n\nThe move toward the Chargers reflects restoration of key offensive linemen, public reaction to Herbert’s passing explosion, and concern over Vikings injuries on the OL. Total has nudged up on market optimism about both offenses’ recent output and defensive vulnerabilities.\n\n# Public and Handle\n\n* **Spread:** \\~60-65% of public bets and handle on the Chargers, but sharp money and some models back the Vikings with points.\n* **Over/Under:** \\~70% bets on over 41.5–44.5, reflecting expectation for offensive fireworks as both teams have trended over in the majority of recent games—though Chargers’ home games have skewed higher despite some “under” results.\n\n# Over/Under and Totals Analysis\n\n* **Vikings:** 4 of last 5 games have hit the over, offense trending up with Wentz at the helm, averaging over 360 total yards in recent stretch.\n* **Chargers:** Recent games have mostly hit the under, but opponent offensive success and defensive meltdown (allowing 38 vs. IND) contribute to the case for a higher total this week.\n* **Under Trends:** Only four of LA’s last twelve games have gone under at home, so with Minnesota’s uptick, the over remains a defensible play.\n\n# Head-to-Head History\n\n* **Series:** Vikings lead 8–7 all-time; Vikings 5–1 ATS in the last six vs. Chargers.\n* **Most Recent:** Chargers won last meeting in September 2023, 28–24, in Minnesota.\n\nThe teams’ encounters often play out closely, consistent with the narrow spread and the strong case for the Vikings to keep it close or even produce a mild upset.\n\n# Coaching Matchup and Strategies\n\n* **Kevin O’Connell (Vikings):** Offensive innovator; historically exploits weak secondaries by employing tempo, motion, and creative route combinations.\n* **Jim Harbaugh (Chargers):** Power spread roots, but with OC Greg Roman, has adapted a pass-centric approach to suit Herbert’s strengths.\n* **Brian Flores (Vikings DC):** Relentless blitzer; leads all defenses in blitz rate, aiming to create negative plays at the risk of big pass completions.\n* **Jesse Minter (Chargers DC):** Multiple 3–4 looks but has struggled to adapt against high-level QBs and deep receiving corps.\n\nThe former Rams colleagues O’Connell and Brandon Staley (Chargers’ previous HC, replaced by Harbaugh in spring 2025) share mutual respect with tactical acumen expected on both sides, further underlining the chess-match nature of this matchup.\n\n# Weather and Venue Impact\n\nSoFi Stadium is a dome, eliminating wind and rain factors. Forecast calls for temperatures near 68°F, light winds, and 0% chance of precipitation—a neutral, scoring-friendly environment that marginally boosts offensive upside, particularly the passing game.\n\n# Expert Predictions and Public Consensus\n\n* **Consensus:** Most national analysts and oddsmakers project a one-score game, split on the outright winner but generally leaning slightly toward the Chargers due to home field and Herbert’s form.\n* **Media Picks:** Multiple expert panels cite the likelihood of the Vikings covering the spread; only a handful are confident in the Chargers exceeding a 3.5-point margin.\n\n# Summary Table: Key Betting and Statistical Trends\n\n|Category|Vikings|Chargers|Analysis|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2025 Record|3-3|4-3|Both teams fighting for playoff spot|\n|ATS Record|3-2-1 (60%)|2-3-1 (40%)|Edge: Vikings ATS|\n|PPG (Offense)|24.2|21.6|Both capable of 3+ TDs|\n|PPG (Defense)|20.8|23.3|Both allow >20 PPG|\n|Last 5 Over/Under|4 Overs, 1 Under|1 Over, 4 Unders|Vikings trending Over|\n|Notable Injuries|OL, FB, RB depth|RBs, OT depth|Banged up, but key QBs/WRs active|\n|Key Prop Over Trend|Jefferson, Mason over|Herbert, McConkey over|Trust offense over defense|\n|Public Betting|\\~35% ML, \\~60% Spread|\\~65% ML, \\~40% Spread|Contrarian plus-line opportunity|\n\nWhile the table summarizes main trends, the game script figures to be shaped by offensive stars attacking two vulnerable defenses in perfect conditions, keeping side, total, and prop overs in play.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Week 8 Vikings-Chargers matchup profiles as a tightly contested, high-ceiling game built on passing volume and skill-position playmaking. **The optimal game bet is Minnesota +3.5, leveraging their against-the-spread success and the Chargers' defensive inconsistencies.** The best player props focus on the teams’ most consistent offensive stars—Herbert, Jefferson, and Mason—all set for extended usage and favorable matchups. A same-game parlay that synthesizes these overs, combined with a modest points threshold for both teams, offers high upside correlated with game flow expectations.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n* **Best Side Bet:** Vikings +3.5\n* **Player Props:**\n   * Herbert Over 253.5 Passing Yards\n   * Jefferson Over 75.5 Receiving Yards\n   * Mason Over 54.5 Rushing Yards\n* **Same Game Parlay:** Herbert Over 253.5 Passing Yards + Jefferson Over 75.5 Rec Yards + Mason Over 54.5 Rush Yards + Both Teams 15+\n* **Predicted Score:** Chargers 27, Vikings 24\n\n",

      "title": "The Iron Pillar of Dhar: A Monumental Feat of Ancient Indian Metallurgy",
      "selftext": "\n\n\n\nThe Iron Pillar of Dhar, a colossal yet underappreciated relic of ancient Indian ingenuity, stands as one of the most remarkable examples of early metallurgical prowess in the subcontinent. Located in the historic town of Dhar, Madhya Pradesh, this fragmented monument, also known as the Dhar Lat, showcases the advanced ironworking techniques that flourished during the medieval period. Despite its impressive scale and corrosion-resistant properties, the pillar remains overshadowed by its more famous counterpart in Delhi. This essay delves into the pillar’s historical significance, its sophisticated construction, its distinctions from the Delhi Iron Pillar, and the multifaceted reasons for its relative obscurity. Through this exploration, we illuminate the technical and cultural brilliance of ancient India and the factors that have kept this marvel in the shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Historical Significance and Context of the Dhar Iron Pillar**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iron Pillar of Dhar is situated within the precincts of the Lat Masjid in Dhar, a city that served as the capital of the Malwa region under the Paramara dynasty. Local traditions attribute its creation to King Bhoja, a celebrated Paramara ruler who reigned from approximately 1010 to 1055 CE. Bhoja, a scholar-king renowned for his contributions to literature, architecture, and science, authored the *Yuktikalpataru*, a treatise that includes detailed discussions on iron production and weaponry, reflecting his deep engagement with metallurgy. The pillar, believed to have been erected as a victory monument, likely stood before a Shiva temple, possibly topped with a trishula (trident), aligning with the Shaivite iconography prevalent during Bhoja’s reign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally, the pillar soared to an estimated height of 14 meters (approximately 42 feet), making it one of the largest forge-welded iron structures ever crafted. Today, it lies in three broken segments on a concrete platform: the longest piece measures about 24 feet, the middle 11 feet, and the shortest 7 feet. Its cross-section transitions from square at the base to octagonal in the middle and circular toward the top, a deliberate design that ensured both structural stability and aesthetic elegance. Small, irregular holes, approximately 1.25 inches in diameter and 1.75–3 inches deep, mark the surface at intervals, likely used by artisans for handling during the forging process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pillar’s history is one of resilience amid upheaval. Following the conquest of Dhar by Alauddin Khilji around 1300 CE, the pillar was toppled and broken. One segment was transported to Mandu around 1405 CE and installed at Dilawar Khan’s mosque, mirroring the Delhi pillar’s relocation to the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque. In 1531 CE, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat attempted to move it, causing further damage. Emperor Akbar inscribed a Persian record on it in 1598 CE, documenting his stay in Dhar during his Deccan campaign. Jahangir later ordered its relocation to Agra, though this plan was never realized. By the British era, the pieces were scattered, but the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) consolidated them in their current horizontal arrangement around 1980 CE. Despite these disruptions, the pillar’s iron remains remarkably resistant to corrosion, a testament to its makers’ skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Metallurgical Mastery of the Dhar Iron Pillar**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dhar pillar’s enduring condition is a marvel of ancient Indian metallurgy. Crafted through forge-welding, the process involved heating iron lumps in coal furnaces and hammering them together to form a cohesive, massive structure. Chemical analysis reveals its composition: 0.013% carbon, 0.06% silicon, 0.072% phosphorus, 0.003% sulfur, 0.057% copper, 0.268% nickel, and the balance iron, with no detectable manganese. The high phosphorus content (up to 0.25% in some samples) is critical to its corrosion resistance, forming a protective passive film of iron hydrogen phosphate hydrate on the surface. This film shields the iron from environmental degradation, particularly in Dhar’s humid climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrostructural studies show fayalitic slag inclusions and phosphorus segregation at grain boundaries, characteristic of wrought iron from this period. Rust analysis identifies layered phases, including magnetite (Fe3-xO4), hematite (α-Fe2O3), goethite (α-FeOOH), lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), akaganeite (β-FeOOH), phosphates, and amorphous δ-FeOOH. While immersion tests indicate inferior performance compared to modern mild steel, the pillar’s atmospheric durability is exceptional, with minimal corrosion after nearly a millennium. This resilience underscores the sophisticated ore selection, smelting, and forging techniques employed by ancient artisans, likely under the patronage of a figure like Bhoja, whose *Yuktikalpataru* suggests familiarity with such processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Comparison with the Iron Pillar of Delhi**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iron Pillar of Delhi, located in the Qutb Minar complex, is a celebrated counterpart to Dhar’s pillar, offering a basis for comparison that highlights both similarities and distinctions. Erected during the Gupta era (circa 375–415 CE) under Chandragupta II Vikramaditya, the Delhi pillar bears a six-line Sanskrit inscription in Brahmi script, identifying it as a standard of Vishnu originally placed at Vishnupadagiri (modern Udayagiri). It was relocated to Delhi in 1233 CE by the Delhi Sultanate. Standing 7.67 meters tall (with 1.12 meters buried), it weighs over 6 tons and tapers from a 16.4-inch diameter at the base to 12 inches at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Physical and Design Differences**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dhar pillar, in its original form, was nearly twice as tall as Delhi’s, with a greater mass (estimated at least one ton heavier). Its cross-sectional variation—square, octagonal, then circular—contrasts with Delhi’s uniform cylindrical taper. The presence of manipulation holes on Dhar’s surface, absent in Delhi, suggests distinct forging techniques tailored to its larger scale. While Delhi’s pillar remains intact and upright, Dhar’s fragmentation into three (possibly four) pieces diminishes its visual impact, lying horizontally rather than standing as a monument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Historical and Contextual Distinctions**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Delhi pillar’s clear inscription ties it to the Gupta empire, a pan-Indian power, while Dhar’s attribution to Bhoja or later Paramara rulers like Arjunavarma Deva (1210–1218 CE) relies on local tradition and lacks epigraphic confirmation. Some scholars propose a Gupta-era origin for Dhar, but evidence remains inconclusive. Delhi’s single relocation preserved its integrity, whereas Dhar’s multiple displacements—under Khilji, Bahadur Shah, and Mughal rulers—caused breakages and scattered its pieces. Delhi’s association with Vishnu contrasts with Dhar’s Shaivite context, reflecting regional religious differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Metallurgical Parallels and Variations**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth pillars are forge-welded wrought iron with high phosphorus content (Delhi: 0.1–0.25%; Dhar: 0.072–0.25%), enabling corrosion resistance through passive films. Delhi’s iron is purer (98%), while Dhar includes trace nickel (0.268%) and copper (0.057%), with no manganese. Both exhibit slag inclusions and similar rust phases (goethite, lepidocrocite, magnetite), but Dhar’s larger size demanded greater forging precision, a feat scholars describe as “ponderous.” Polarization studies show both pillars excel in atmospheric conditions despite underperforming in immersion tests compared to modern steel. Dhar’s slightly higher phosphorus and nickel content may enhance its passivation, though its handling has led to more pronounced rust in areas.\n\nThese differences underscore how physical condition, historical clarity, and cultural context shape the pillars’ respective legacies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Reasons for the Dhar Pillar’s Underrated Status**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite its grandeur and technological sophistication, the Iron Pillar of Dhar remains largely overlooked, a result of geographical, historical, scholarly, and cultural factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Geographical Isolation**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDhar, a small town in Madhya Pradesh, lacks the global prominence of Delhi, a metropolitan hub and UNESCO World Heritage site. The Delhi pillar, integrated into the Qutb complex’s mosque courtyard, attracts tourists and scholars, while Dhar’s pillar, beside the lesser-known Lat Masjid, sees limited visitors. Accessibility challenges, with Dhar’s remote location compared to Delhi’s urban infrastructure, further reduce its exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Physical Degradation**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dhar pillar’s broken, horizontal state contrasts starkly with Delhi’s intact, upright form, which exudes enduring strength. Repeated conquests and relocations erased potential inscriptions and altered its surface, diminishing its authenticity in public perception. Delhi’s preserved inscription and single relocation enhance its historical clarity and visual appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Scholarly Neglect**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recent studies, such as those in the early 2000s, the Dhar pillar received minimal academic attention compared to Delhi’s extensive documentation. The latter has inspired books, global discourse, and even pseudoscientific theories, while Dhar’s analyses are confined to niche journals. Colonial-era archaeologists prioritized Delhi’s “rustless wonder” in accessible urban settings, sidelining regional artifacts like Dhar’s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Cultural and Narrative Biases**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Delhi pillar benefits from its association with the Gupta empire, a symbol of pan-Indian glory, while Dhar’s ties to the regional Paramara dynasty, despite Bhoja’s scholarly renown, carry less weight in national narratives. Media and educational materials amplify Delhi’s mystique, often portraying its non-rusting as a “miracle,” while Dhar’s similar properties go unnoticed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Conservation Disparities**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Delhi pillar enjoys robust ASI protection, ongoing studies, and promotional efforts, whereas Dhar’s pillar, though safeguarded, lacks interpretive centers or campaigns to highlight its significance. This reflects broader inequities in heritage management, where urban, intact monuments dominate attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese factors collectively obscure the Dhar pillar’s monumental achievement, despite its technical parity with Delhi’s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Conclusion**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iron Pillar of Dhar, with its towering original height, intricate design, and remarkable corrosion resistance, stands as a pinnacle of ancient Indian metallurgy, rivaling the Delhi pillar in craftsmanship. Its attribution to King Bhoja aligns with his scholarly legacy, yet its fragmented state, regional context, and limited scholarly focus have kept it underrated. By recognizing the Dhar pillar’s significance, we can bridge the gap in appreciating India’s diverse heritage, ensuring this metallurgical marvel receives the admiration it deserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n **Sources*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Balasubramaniam, R.

      "selftext": "https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/22/louisiana-staffing-trend/\n\nLouisiana state agency staffing trend shows more employees, but worker shortages persist\n\nWorker vacancy rate hovers at 14%\n\nThe number of state employees in Louisiana increased 5.4% from 2021 through 2024, but staffing shortages remain across most state agencies with an average vacancy rate of 14%, according to a recent review. \n\nLegislative Auditor Mike Waguespack [published a report](https://app2.lla.state.la.us/publicreports.nsf/0/179b2b8e25a04fd686258d2200582d8e/$file/00008d3b.pdf?openelement&.7773098) Monday on state government staffing trends from fiscal years 2020-21 through 2023-24. *The report featured staffing trends across all executive branch agencies and higher education.* \n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the total number of employees in executive branch agencies, including contract employees, was 37,465, up from 35,553 in 2021. The 2024 number exceeded the roughly 36,000 state employees before the coronavirus pandemic but *remains slightly below where it was about a decade ago in 2013 at 37,665*, according to the report.\n\nCompared with other states, Louisiana is roughly in the middle of the pack when it comes to its total of full-time equivalent workers across all agencies per 10,000 residents. A full-time equivalent includes both classified and unclassified civil servants. Additionally, two part-time workers who each work 20 hours per week, are counted as one full-time equivalent. \n\nWith roughly 75,215 full-time equivalents, Louisiana ranks 22nd nationally and fourth regionally out of 10 southeastern states, the report notes.\n\nThe staffing shortages at state agencies appear to be slowly but steadily improving since the mid-pandemic peak of 16.4% during the 2021-22 fiscal year. The average vacancy rate has improved each year since then and now sits at 14%.\n\n**States agencies with the highest average vacancy rates from 2021-24 are ones that have generally struggled with chronic staffing shortages. They include the Department of Children and Family Services and the Office of Juvenile Justice.** \n\nWith a **34% vacancy rate, DCFS has long struggled to recruit child welfare workers** because of the stressful nature of the job and its** low pay**, according to a [June report](https://app2.lla.state.la.us/publicreports.nsf/0/4b6ab151f5e8a2a486258ca10055f46e/$file/00007bcaa.pdf?openelement&.7773098) from Waguespack’s office that focused specifically on the agency’s staffing troubles.\n\nThe **midpoint pay for state social services employees**, which includes child welfare workers at DCFS and other agencies, **remains about 2% below the private sector pay** but is competitive when compared with what other states pay, according to a separate [report](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/668518683/20/) from the State Civil Service Commission. Louisiana pays its social services workers a median salary of $57,307 compared with the $53,457 regional average, according to that report.\n\nAlthough it had a high average vacancy rate over the previous four fiscal years, the Office of Juvenile Justice saw an improvement in its staffing rate during 2023-24 but not because it gained a bunch of new employees. The improvement is largely a result of the closure of one of its facilities, the temporary Bridge City Center for Youth at Louisiana State Penitentiary, according to the auditor’s report. This improved the Juvenile Justice staffing shortage from 27.7% in 2023 to 11.7% in 2024, the report noted.\n\n\n\nIn 2023, the agency entered into a $9.5 million private security contract to staff two of its youth prisons with a total of 52 employees. OJJ agreed to pay the company, Coleman Consulting Group, LLC, a $75 hourly wage for labor and cover the cost of lodging, food and travel, though the guards who work for the company can only receive  as much as $25 per hour, according to an article from The Lens. \n\nAdditionally, in August 2024, the State Civil Service Commission increased pay for protective services employees, which includes police officers, prison guards and parole officers. The midpoint salary in the protective services is now $71,223, compared with $66,732 in the private sector, a marked increase from the previous year when it sat roughly 0.4% below the private sector median salary.\n\nThe third highest vacancy rate, at 20.6%, belonged to the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs, though its shortage improved roughly 4 percentage points in the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Louisiana VA Secretary Col. Charlton Meginley said the vacancies are primarily for nursing assistants in the state’s veteran homes. Those homes saw an influx of residents during the pandemic, but those have started to level off, reducing some of their staffing needs, he said.\n\n**Staffing shortages have been a consistent issue across all state agencies.** Aside from the pay bumps for police and prison guards, **more than 70% of all classified employees in Louisiana do not make as much as their peers in the private sector or in the public sector in other states**, though this isn’t necessarily the sole reason for the vacancies, according to the Civil Service Commission.\n\n“**Regarding the causes of vacancies, these can vary and may include factors such as pay,[ working conditions and other agency-specific circumstances](https://old.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/1ljg963/sorry_state_employees/mzjx6pk/)**,” Civil Service Public Information Director Lindsay Ruiz de Chavez said.\n\nThe auditor’s report included a separate, brief analysis of staffing trends across Louisiana’s public colleges and universities. Higher education staffing is down 5.4% from 2021, though it saw about a 2% uptick from 2023-24 with a total of 28,727 employees. The shortages largely occurred among the state’s smaller universities, community colleges and satellite campuses. Among the exceptions to this was LSU, which lost 1,370 employees since 2021 — a 19.4% decrease. \n\nOther colleges gained employees, including the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, which has gained about 120 workers for a 6.7% uptick.",

      "title": "Average Private Health Insurance Cost UK The Latest Data for 2025",
      "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI know one of the most common questions here is about what people can realistically expect to pay for cover. It's a tricky thing to pin down, so I've gone through some new 2025 market data to pull out the key takeaways for the community.\n\nBefore getting into the numbers, it's worth highlighting the most important principle of UK PMI: standard policies are designed to cover acute conditions (things that are likely to be resolved with treatment). They generally do not cover chronic or pre-existing conditions. This is a fundamental point that often causes confusion.\n\nThe data shows age is by far the biggest factor in pricing. Here’s a rough monthly breakdown based on a non-smoker with a mid-range policy and a £250 excess:\n\n- **20s:** £35 - £75\n- **30s:** £45 - £100\n- **40s:** £60 - £140\n- **50s:** £85 - £200\n- **60s:** £120 - £280\n\nThe lower end of these ranges typically represents basic cover, while the higher end is for more comprehensive plans. As you can see, the cost increases significantly with each decade.\n\nBeyond age, the other major factor is your location. Premiums in central London and other major cities are often higher due to the cost of the private hospitals in those areas. Someone in a more rural location might pay noticeably less than someone in a city for the exact same policy.\n\nFull disclosure: these insights are from a guide I work on.\n\nFor those of you with policies, how does this data compare to your own experience? Have you found location to be a significant factor in your quotes, or have other things like underwriting type made a bigger difference over time?\n\nhttps://wecovr.com/guides/average-private-health-insurance-cost-uk-the-latest-data-for-2025?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=rd-community",

In particular, Psionic Lightning is TWICE as powerful as Cloud Lightning with basically no downsides, making L-Slot penetration battleships a pretty viable option, especially against fallen empire that have lategame tech but don't use any hardening.\n\n  \nPsionic Bombers are noteworthy for giving your battleships a damage multiplier based on ship size. On the surface, they're only equivalent to T2 strike craft, but when you assume you get a minimum 50% bonus to your damage (minimum ship size is 1, not 0) they're actually immediately better than even the Skravird craft, scaling up to a ridiculous 156.5 DPS, **three times as much as the RNG-based Skravird**. Their main weakness is their low tracking, which is only 35% compared to the 80+% of normal strikecraft, but since their accuracy is 100% this isn't as much of a factor, especially considering all strikecraft have 100% accuracy and Psionic computers get +10% tracking anyway you'll hardly struggle to hit even without any other bonuses.\n\n  \nOn Defense:\n\n  \nThings are much simpler here. Psionic shields are a straight upgrade to Dark Matter shields, but there's no psionic equivalent to Dragonscale - but it's worth noting you don't technically need Cosmo to get dragonscale, if you can kill the ether drake. The difference in armor just slightly edges out the difference in shields, meaning without cloaking this can go both ways.\n\nThrusters are a clear Cosmogenesis victory, with +2 Evasion (minimum, +5 maximum) against the next best since there are no psionic thrusters, and a shocking +50% sublight speed difference. If you wanna go fast, go Cosmogenesis. Cloaking, however, is the exact opposite, where psionic cloaking is +1 stronger across the board AND doesn't get any shield nullification when paired with psionic shields.\n\n  \nOn Axiliaries:\n\n  \nPsi-Computers are generally weak, losing a good chunk of their bonuses in exchange for +10% tracking, BUT you don't need cosmo for T3 computers, meaning it's not a HUGE loss. Psionic hypedrives are also straight better, with a bonus disengage opportunity (the only way to get it aside from commander bonuses) and a slight advantage for charge time, which is basically nothing late-game.\n\n  \nA noteworthy Cosmo win is the fact that there's no psi reactor, meaning Dark Matter Reactors are quite important, especially late-game and being much better than their zero-point counterpart. This effectively allows you to either use more shields - if that's your build, mine usually are - or use an extra aux slot on something useful rather than a reactor booster.\n\n  \nConclusion:\n\nThis is kinda pointless since they're not mutually exclusive, but generally speaking Psionic has Cosmogenesis beat pretty handily. In particular, Psionic bombers are INSANELY overpowered. You might say 'oh, bombers are weak to corvetters and corvettes are the current meta, so they're actually weak' to which i say psionic can use corvettes just as well, arguably better, since arty vettes aren't meaningfully improved by cosmogenesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Raw Numbers:\n\n\n\n`Dark Matter VS Psionic (at peak)`\n\n\n\n`- Core -`\n\n\n\n`Reactor:`\n\n\n\n`2000 - 1550 Power`\n\n\n\n`Hyperdrive:`\n\n\n\n`1 - 2 Disengagement Opportunities`\n\n`-70% - -80% Charge Time`\n\n\n\n`Computer:`\n\n\n\n`+20% - +15% Firerate`\n\n`+20% - +15% Range`\n\n`0 - +10 Tracking`\n\n\n\n`Thrusters:`\n\n\n\n`+8 - +6 Evasion`\n\n`+125% + 75% Sublight Speed`\n\n\n\n`- Auxiliary -`\n\n\n\n`Armor:`\n\n\n\n`2220 - 1740 Armor`\n\n\n\n`Shields:`\n\n\n\n`1680 - 2160 Shield Health`\n\n`11.1 - 12.5 Shield Regen`\n\n\n\n`Cloaking:`\n\n\n\n`1 - 2 Cloaking Strenght`\n\n`-50% - 0% - Shield Nullification`\n\n\n\n`- Weapons -`\n\n\n\n`Disruptors:`\n\n\n\n`7.2 - 9.26 - Average Damage`\n\n\n\n\n\n`60% - 60% Tracking`\n\n\n\n\n\n`Lightning:`\n\n\n\n`7.48 - 15.56 Average Damage`\n\n`30% - 30% Tracking`\n\n\n\n`Strike Craft: (Non-skravird)`\n\n\n\n`40 - 31.30 Average Damage*`\n\n`25 - 35 Shields`\n\n`700 - 800 Speed`\n\n`80% - 35% Tracking`\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "**Aveanna Healthcare Holdings, Inc.** ($AVAH): AVAH: 10% Owner Sells $75.1M in Stock via Secondary Offering",
      "selftext": "\n\n\n---\n\n## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n#### SEC Filing Analysis: Aveanna Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (AVAH)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: High\n- **Key Takeaway**: J.H. Whitney, a 10% owner, executed a substantial $75.1 million sale, liquidating a significant portion of its holdings through a secondary offering.\n- **Market Impact**: The sale is highly material, representing 3.51% of the company's market cap, which could create short-term selling pressure on the stock.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Company | Aveanna Healthcare Holdings, Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | AVAH |\n| CIK | 0001832332 |\n| Industry | SERVICES-HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Name | J.H. Whitney Equity Partners VII, LLC |\n| CIK | 0001567459 |\n| Title/Position | null |\n| Relationship | 10% Owner |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Form Type | 4 |\n| Transaction Date | 2025-10-21 |\n| Transaction Code | S (Sale) |\n| Security Type | Common Stock, $0.01 par value |\n| Shares Involved | 8,346,059 |\n| Price Per Share | $9.00 |\n| Total Value | $75,114,531 |\n| Shares Owned After | 37,494,539 |\n| Ownership Type | Indirect |\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\n#### Transaction Materiality\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Transaction Value | $75,114,531 |\n| % of Market Cap | 3.51% |\n| Shares Transacted | 8,346,059 |\n| % of Shares Outstanding | 3.99% |\n| Post-Transaction Ownership | 37,494,539 shares (17.95% of outstanding) |\n| Materiality Assessment | Highly Significant |\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Market Cap Context**: For a company with a $2.14 billion market cap, this $75.1 million sale is substantial and highly visible to the market.\n- **Ownership Concentration**: The sale reduced J.H. Whitney's holdings from approximately 22% to 18% of the company. Despite the large sale, the firm remains a deeply entrenched major shareholder.\n- **Dilution Impact**: Not applicable as this is a secondary sale of existing shares, not an issuance of new equity.\n- **Transaction Significance**: The transaction is highly significant, exceeding the 1% of market cap and 0.5% of shares outstanding thresholds. This indicates a major liquidity event for the selling shareholder.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Negative to Neutral\n- **Reasoning**: A sale of this magnitude by a major private equity holder is typically viewed as a bearish signal, as it increases the public float and can signal the insider's belief that the stock is fairly valued. However, the fact that it was an organized secondary offering, and that the seller retains a very large stake, may temper the negative reaction.\n\n#### Volume & Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: High. A secondary offering of this size will be accompanied by a significant spike in trading volume around the transaction date.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Bearish. Large insider sales, especially from institutional owners, tend to create negative sentiment among investors, who may see it as an opportune time for the 'smart money' to exit.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- The selling entity, J.H. Whitney, still retains a very large position of nearly 18%, indicating continued significant alignment with common shareholders.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- The sale represents a major disposition and could signal the beginning of a longer-term exit by a key financial sponsor.\n- The large increase in freely traded shares could create a supply overhang, potentially putting downward pressure on the stock price in the near term.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. A major institutional owner, J.H. Whitney, sold $75.1 million worth of AVAH stock.\n2. The sale was highly material, representing 3.51% of the company's market cap and 3.99% of its shares outstanding.\n3. Despite the sale, the insider remains the largest shareholder with an ~18% stake, which provides some stability.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\n#### Transaction Notes\n\n- **Special Circumstances**: The footnote explicitly states the sale was conducted as part of an \"underwritten secondary offering,\" which is a formal, organized method for large shareholders to sell stock to the public.\n- **Market Environment**: This type of sale by a private equity firm is common as their investment funds mature and they seek to return capital to their limited partners.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

      "title": "Introducing the Strife System - created for my TTRPG, Faera Strife (WIP, Part 1)",
      "selftext": "(taken from an excerpt of the first book I've been working on - *Faera Strife - the Faeran's Guide,* inspired by D&D's core rulebooks. Faera is the setting, Faerans are players, the Librarian is the DM.)\n\nFeel free to poke, prod, ask questions, etc!\n\n**the Strife System**\n\nIn the beautiful but dangerous world of Faera, growth and experience are hard-earned and are vital to living a long and prosperous life. Most often the result of collaboration and community, they are also the result of overcoming obstacles, conflict, and near-constant strife.\n\nAt your table, the success or failure of your efforts are determined by **the Strife System**. Instead of being chained to arbitrary, unchanging thresholds or blown about by the whims of random chance, **Strife** is designed to be an accurate approximation of your growth in Faera, both as an individual and in combat, conflict, or collaboration with others.\n\n**The Strife System** is governed by four factors: **Effort, Experience, Intent,** and **Impact**.\n\n**Effort** refers to how much focus or energy one must devote to an attempt or task. The amount of effort one must devote to an attempt usually corresponds to how experienced one is with said task.\n\n**Experience** refers to how practiced or knowledgeable one is in relation to an attempt or task. More experience usually equates to an increased chance for success when attempting a task.\n\n**Intent** refers to the desired or intended effect one wishes to achieve when attempting a task.\n\n**Impact** refers to the actual effect achieved by the attempt and affects its end result.\n\n*Note: It is extremely important for each Faeran to be very specific about the full intended effect they hope to achieve when attempting a task, especially in the fields of* ***Study*** *or* ***Source****. Not doing so can result in unexpected or even catastrophic results, as we’ll soon see.*\n\n*In some cases, the* ***Librarian*** *must also be very clear on the consequences of a failed attempt. For example, it is in no way inappropriate to warn the table that a failed attempt would result in dismemberment, death, or other adverse effect – within reason, of course. Some troublesome Faerans must be allowed to play the fool and allow their party to learn from their passing. After all, the Librarian’s first priorities are to serve the inhabitants of* ***Faera,*** *improve their lives, and preserve their memory, not necessarily to save them from every ill they wish to throw themselves into.*\n\n**the Divide**\n\nThese factors are measured by **the Divide**. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe primary tool used to determine the effects of **Effort** and **Experience** on the **Intent vs. Impact** of an attempt is the roll of a d20 die.\n\nEach facet of the d20 signifies 5% of success for a given roll.\n\nFor example:\n\n5% x 5 = 25%                  5% x 10 = 50%               5% x 15= 75%                5% x 20 = 100%\n\nFor independent tasks, the **Effort** and **Experience** of a character determines the probability of a character to achieve their **Intended Impact**, and their overall success is determined by the d20 roll. Less experienced characters will often face a disadvantaged roll, whereas more experienced characters’ previous efforts and successes allow them an advantaged roll.\n\nWe will look much more closely at advancement and the effects of **Experience** later.\n\n**The Divide** is the gap between the **Intent** and the **Impact** of an attempt and is largely the responsibility of the **Librarian** to determine based on the roll. If **the Divide** is relatively small, for example a 14 roll on a required 15, the Faeran in question only *just* failed the attempt and should face little adverse consequence, whereas a 2 roll on a required 15 is unwelcome news indeed, with potentially serious adverse consequences.\n\n**Critical Impacts (**or more commonly, **Criticals)** are triggered on competing rolls exactly 10 facets apart.\n\nFor example, an 11 vs a 1 is a critical, as is a 12 vs a 2, and so on.\n\nA **Vital Impact** (sometimes known as a **Miracle**) is triggered only when competing rolls result in a 20 vs 1.\n\nVery basically, within **the Strife System**, early successful **Efforts** on disadvantaged rolls result in advancement and later, **Experience**, which results in advantaged rolls and less effort required over time as a result of repeated successes.\n\n**The Divide** determines the advantages and/or adversities along the way via Rolls and determines the ultimate **Impact** of an attempt vs the Faeran’s **Intent**.\n\n**Let’s look at an example:**\n\n***A Camber Dwarf, a Whelp Runesmith****, attempts to strike a basic rune of lightness into a hammer. The task calls for a roll of 15 for a successful rune, but anything below this results in a much less effective version.*\n\n*The Dwarf rolls a 7. His rune is etched into the hammer, but it’s scratched and imperfect. It’s obvious this attempt has failed and the Dwarf must reheat the metal and try again.*\n\n*The Dwarf again reattempts to etch the rune. The Dwarf rolls a 13. This etching is much cleaner and more uniform, but remains inert. The attempt has again failed.*\n\n*The Dwarf reheats the metal and tries again to etch the rune. The Dwarf rolls a 1. The etching is much too deep, scoring the hammer’s side, ruining it. The Dwarf has failed and must either try to forge a new hammer or discard it and use another.*\n\n*Luckily, the Dwarf is a* ***Journeyman Smith****, and the hammer’s design is well known to him. He has to roll a 10 for a decent hammer. He rolls a 15, and the resulting hammer is fine indeed.*\n\n*He rolls up his sleeves, takes a breath, and takes his rune etching to task yet again. He rolls an 18. As he finishes the fine details of the rune, it briefly hums and he can feel it cool and sink into the hot metal as the rune takes to its new home. Success!*\n\n\\*              \\*              \\*\n\nIn this example, our **Camber** friend is a **Whelp Runesmith**, which means on a spectrum of experience, he’s less than 25% proficient with etching and wielding runes. As a result, he has a much more difficult time successfully completing the etching.\n\nHowever, he’s also a **Journeyman Smith**, which means he’s about 50% proficient with crafting Iron weapons. This means he has a good chance of creating a hammer, and a good chance of making a great one.\n\nAs he’s had little successful **Effort** put into the skill, the Dwarf’s lack of **Experience** with **Runesmithing** meant he had a more difficult go of it, but his time gained **Smithing** means he has more **Experience** to draw on as a result of his previous **Efforts**.\n\nIn this case, as his **Intent** was clear (the etching of the lightness rune) **the Librarian** was able to determine the **Impact** of each attempt based on the Dwarf’s roll.\n\nAs there was no combat or conflict outside of his own effort, the Dwarf’s only contention was a single successful roll.\n\n\\*              \\*              \\*\n\n**Let’s look at another, more catastrophic attempt:**\n\n*A* ***Cordéan*** *and a* ***Dark Elf Seer****, both* ***Novices*** *and bitter rivals, challenge the other to cast* ***Flare****, an advanced spell of Blaze magic. As Blaze magic is usually powered by more active emotions such as intense anger and rage, it requires a combination of* ***Faith, Fortitude,*** *and* ***Insight*** *in order to successfully cast and maintain.*\n\n*It also bears mentioning that Blaze magic is a highly dangerous and volatile power to wield; even trained Mages have difficulty in doing so.*\n\n*Provoked by a jeering crowd of their peers, both* ***Novice Seers*** *decide to cast the spell at the same time, forgoing turns. The challenge is to cast the spell and hold the resulting flame on one’s arm, directing the flame out like a blazing sword.*\n\n*While the* ***Cordéan*** *has a wealth of anger to draw upon and a similar level of faith to his* ***Dark Elf*** *counterpart, she has previous mentorship from the Black Mages of Atuah that has provided her with much more fortitude and insight.*\n\n*For a* ***Novice****, there are two phases required to cast* ***Flare****: Inspiration, then Ignition.*\n\n*The required roll for a* ***Novice Seer*** *to cast* ***Flare’s*** *Inspiration is d15.*\n\n*The required roll for a* ***Novice Seer*** *to cast* ***Flare’s*** *Ignition is d30.*\n\n*They roll.*\n\n*The* ***Cordéan r****olls 18 on Inspiration.* *The* ***Dark Elf*** *rolls 15.*\n\n*They both inhale, their backs arched as the power of the surrounding air enters their lungs, their blood sucking in its power greedily as it surges through their bloodstream, their hearts beating in time with their summoned rage. They both begin to sweat profusely as they try to focus their breathing to accommodate the sudden surge of adrenaline and power coursing through their veins. Their casting hands both tremble as they proceed to ignite. The* ***Cordéan*** *smiles, knowing he has the upper hand.*\n\n*They roll.*\n\n*On Flare’s Ignition, the* ***Dark Elf*** *rolls a 19. The* ***Cordéan*** *rolls a 3.*\n\n*On instinct at the intense searing flowing down her arm, the Dark Elf drops to her knees and casts her people’s inherent* ***Voidveil*** *and envelops the hungry* ***Flareflame*** *in* ***Void Shadow****, slowly dissipating the painful and destructive force before it can devour her entire limb.*\n\n*In her own panic and agony, it took her a few moments to realize that the* ***Cordéan*** *lad’s arm* *across from her had detonated at the shoulder, throwing the ashes of the pulverized and shattered bones of his arm at the surrounding students before he fell. He felt nothing.*\n\n*As the screams of the frightened students faded around her, the last thing the* ***Dark Elf*** *could detail before she lost consciousness was the sight of the charred flesh and the melted bone of her fallen rival.*\n\n\\*              \\*              \\*\n\nIn this example, our **Novice Seers** are hopelessly understudied and inexperienced to cast such an advanced spell, resulting in great difficulty for both of them. In truth, they’re both fortunate to have rolled so high on their Inspiration, as failing those could have resulted in injuries as severe as losing consciousness, nosebleeds, migraines, and more.\n\nAs they’ve had little Experience with Blaze magic, they both faced insurmountable odds in casting the Ignition phase of **Flare**. While their **Intent** was clear (the focused Flare “blade”) **the Librarian** was able to determine the **Impact** of each attempt based on their rolls.\n\nAlso note how t**he Librarian** took into account the available abilities of each of the novices when determining the **Impact** of their casts.\n\nThe **Cordéan’s** challenge was twofold**,** not only did he not have the Atuan training of his rival, his roll also didn’t allow him to use his Insight to plan ahead in case his cast went awry.\n\n*(That doesn’t mean he couldn’t or didn’t plan ahead, it simply means his roll was too low to allow him to employ his plan, had he one in mind.)*\n\nIn the **Dark Elf’s** case, she had multiple advantages to compensate for her lack of **Experience** with Blaze magic. In part due to her roll, she had the **Fortitude** to act while in intense pain and the **Insight** to cast an ameliorative spell, in addition to the **Dark Elven** benefit of having access to **Voidveil**. That last bit is especially important, as without that ability, our young friend may have lost her arm as well.\n\nNote that while they each rolled to cast their spells, they did not roll *against* each other. As there was no combat or conflict outside of themselves, the two novices only had to contend with their respective independent rolls.\n\n\\*              \\*              \\*\n\nNote that **Rolls** aren’t intended to be used for every little damn thing a **Librarian** or **Faeran** can think of. The Dwarf in the above example didn’t have to roll Dexterity for each strike of his crafting hammer, or roll Strength to forge the new hammer, or roll Constitution to wipe the sweat off his brow, though it is true some tasks have multiple steps in order to be successful.\n\nLikewise, the Novices didn’t have to roll Fortitude or Constitution on every single breath they took during Flare’s Inspiration, nor did they have to roll Perception to determine the surrounding students’ effects on them. Don’t bog yourselves down in dumb shit.\n\nAs a general rule, roll for what’s important to put **Effort** into, predominantly in instances where the **Impact vs. Intent** of an action isn’t easily predictable and/or determinable and use the **Faeran** and **Librarian’s** coordination and cooperation for the rest.",

      "title": "Humanity has a Civilizational Expansion Index of 1, making them an existential threat for the galaxy.",
      "selftext": "\"Esteemed delegates, I have requested this emergency audience to announce a grave development. According to the latest sociometric reports, the species known as Homo sapiens of Sol-3, located in the mid-Orion Arm, has reached a Civilizational Expansion Index of one point zero three.\"\n\nSilence descended across the Galactic Senate. Photoreceptors, scent organs, and antennae all turned toward the Klaxian.\n\nThe scholar pressed a control, and a holographic map of the galaxy unfolded above the central podium. A single red dot pulsing at the position of the human homeworld.\n\n\"Projected galactic expansion: total.\"\n\nThe chamber erupted as the dot swelled, painting the whole holographic galaxy red.\n\nAlarm pheromones thickened the air. An insectoid delegate released a piercing screech that reverberated through the hall. Molluscoids representatives tried helplessly to retract into shells far too small for their obese bodies.\n\nAmid the uproar, the Klaxian waited, unmoving, until the cacophony began to fade.\n\n\"Let me remind you of the Civilizational Expansion Index, or CEI. It was developed after the Moglan War, in the hope of predicting and preventing similar catastrophes.\n\nThe CEI measures a species' inherent tendency to expand. It is estimated from multiple xeno-sociological factors: natality, aggression, curiosity, greed, risk tolerance, and others.\n\nWhen the CEI is below 1, a civilization may expand for a time, but its growth rate will inevitably slow and stop. Such species are diverse, yet they share a common pragmatism: a preference for long-term stability over short-term gain.\n\nMost spacefaring species have a CEI below 0.5. Their expansion is brief, then they consolidate or withdraw. Every member of the Galactic Union belongs to this stable group.\n\nA few, more volatile, civilizations fall between 0.5 and 1. They can expand significantly but always reach a plateau. The infamous Moglans, for instance, had a CEI of about 0.87 when they discovered faster-than-light travel. Their empire reached across 4.7% of the galaxy, exterminating trillions. Yet their population collapsed once automation made offspring unnecessary, as they used to reproduce only to create servants. With dwindling birth rates and finite needs, their expansion ceased.\n\nWith a CEI above 1, a civilization reproduces exponentially and consumes every accessible resource, often waging war even against itself. Such species invariably self-destruct before becoming spacefaring, their worlds exhausted or poisoned beyond recovery. Therefore these hyper-aggressive civilizations pose no threat to the rest of the galaxy. The only danger would come from their accidental acquisition of advanced technology, hence the strict quarantines around primitive worlds.\n\nBut there is a third category: civilizations with a CEI very close to 1. These rare species may reach the space age before their self-destructive tendencies overtake them. If that happens, they will expand exponentially until the entire galaxy is consumed.\n\nFortunately, such cases are statistically unlikely. Even when a species briefly stabilizes near a CEI of 1, the value usually drifts, rising toward extinction or falling toward stability.\n\nLet us return to today's subject: Homo sapiens, humans.\n\nAt first glance, they are an unremarkable species. Their bodies are frail, their cognition merely average, and their lifespan extremely short, 100 cycles at its maximum.\n\nCulturally, however, they are an oddity. Their societies are ever changing, with new cultural groups emerging regularly and coexisting, sometimes uneasily, within the same civilization. Despite their capacity for reason, their instinct to follow leaders or collective trends is overwhelmingly strong. As a result, even the most irrational ideas, such as worshipping invisible mystical entities, can attract billions of adherents. And even when a more rational ideology arises, they tend to distort it over time, pushing it toward extremism until it doesn't make any sense anymore.\n\nAs diverse as they are, all human societies share a few constants: greed, expansionism, and a persistent drive for the dominant groups to subjugate or eliminate the weaker ones.\n\nThese traits kept their CEI consistently high, around 1.3 for most of their recorded history. This value was not high enough, however, to prevent all technological progress. So they advanced slowly. Until roughly 250 cycles ago, during their industrial transition, when their progress accelerated sharply. Wars and economic competition accelerated further innovation, though not to a degree considered anomalous.\n\n75 cycles ago, their CEI was estimated at 1.29. Our models predicted escalating conflicts of increasing scale, and the observations confirmed it. With the advent of atomic weaponry and the devastation they were able to unleash upon one another, we were confident their collapse was imminent.\n\nYet, against expectation, they recognized the danger themselves. Despite their nature, rival nations refrained from crossing the final threshold. They even founded a global organization uniting the major powers of their world. Still, the violence never truly ceased, it merely evolved. They continued to kill, but in ways calculated to avoid provoking a world-ending response.\n\nYes, I can see your expressions of disgust. I share them. It is difficult to comprehend how such a barbaric species, barely more than animals, could imitate our own galactic institutions while continuing to slaughter one another. Yet it is precisely this contradiction that led us to classify them as potentially dangerous.\n\nTheir CEI was subsequently re-evaluated from 1.29 to 1.08. Such a drastic shift is rare, though not unheard of among culturally driven species.\n\nAt 1.08, long-term self-destruction remained inevitable, but a brief period of stability became statistically possible.\n\nOnly a few cycles later, their two dominant nations launched ambitious space programs, dedicating immense resources. To them, it was a means of competing without direct warfare. To us, it was another alarming anomaly. Their technological progress accelerated beyond expectations. Even a short window of stability, perhaps a hundred cycles, could allow them to leave their homeworld and begin interstellar expansion.\n\nThat possibility was enough to elevate humanity to the highest threat level ever recorded by our monitoring program. We deployed additional stealth probes to gather every possible detail.\n\nWe were quickly reassured. Only two outcomes appeared likely: a short-term civilizational collapse through nuclear conflict, or long-term stabilization as their CEI continued to decrease.\n\nIndeed, during this period their culture shifted from warlike to economically driven. They remained extremely greedy, exploiting their planet’s resources far beyond sustainable limits and altering their atmosphere in ways that endangered their own long-term survival. Yet trade and economic interdependence fostered unprecedented global cooperation. Wars, though still frequent, diminished in scale and intensity. Birth rates declined sharply. They even began, however imperfectly, to recognize others’ right to live and be free, including those of foreign nations.\n\nTherefore, their CEI showed a steady downward trend. Fifteen cycles ago, it reached a historical low of 0.94. This value is still high by galactic standards, but not alarming, and all predictive models agreed it would fall well below the danger threshold long before they achieved interstellar capability\n\nBut the latest update changed everything.\n\nResource exhaustion, pollution, and large-scale environmental degradation have begun to slow their economy. Not collapse, merely a slower growth rate. Yet their entire culture is built around the concept of perpetual growth. I understand this sound irrational. How can a species confined to a single world believe in infinite growth? Yet they do.\n\nMany humans are aware of the contradiction. Some advocate restraint, resource conservation, and long-term development over immediate profit. Their efforts, however, remain insufficient to prevent an impending planetary crisis. But culturally, this slow shift should have continued to lower their CEI.\n\nAt least, that was what our projections indicated. But once again, human culture defied prediction. Instead of following the trend toward sustainability, increasing numbers of humans began to reject moderation entirely, seeking to exploit the remaining resources as rapidly as possible, indifferent to collective survival. This egocentric impulse had always been present, but the crisis appears to amplify it. Worse, many of their most powerful leaders had risen through this same system of unchecked growth, and now use their influence to preserve it.\n\nThis reversal is driving the recent increase of humanity's CEI to 1.03. Our projections indicate growing cultural instability that could push the index in either direction.\n\nAdmittedly, our models struggle to capture the behavior of a species as chaotic as humans. Still, based on current data, we foresee three primary scenarios.\n\nThe most probable outcome, with an estimated 54% likelihood, is a total civilizational collapse before humanity can expand beyond its home system. This could result from technological progress failing to keep pace with resource depletion, or from a global war ending their industrial capacity.\n\nThe second scenario, at 39% probability, is a gradual decrease of their CEI to a non-critical level, allowing long-term stability. Even then, their index would likely remain above 0.7, meaning they could still expand significantly. Much like the Moglans once did. In that case, we would at least have forewarning and could evacuate nearby systems in time.\n\nHowever, this scenario carries an additional risk. Humanity is culturally heterogeneous to an extreme degree. Even if their overall CEI falls below 1, splinter civilizations with values above 1 could emerge independently. Containment might be possible by supporting the dominant human authority in suppressing them, but such efforts would be hazardous and uncertain.\n\nThe third scenario, with a 7% probability, is the catastrophic one. In this case, humans achieve faster-than-light travel while maintaining a CEI greater than 1. Under normal sociological conditions, this should be impossible. Yet their brief phase of relative stability combined with rapid technological progress may have given them the time needed to develop sufficient off-world industry before their planet's exhaustion. Their large natural satellite, along with the numerous metal-rich asteroids orbiting their star, could then supply them with resources for hundreds of cycles.\n\nIf this occurs... we are finished. They will expand across the entire galaxy, exterminating or enslaving every civilization in their path.\"\n\nThe assembly, which had already struggled to remain calm, descended into chaos. Delegates shouted over one another in an incomprehensible cacophony. Security drones flooded the aisles, projecting containment barriers that shimmered uselessly as representatives surged toward the exit ports, larger beings trampling the smaller ones in panic.\n\nThe Chancellor's amplified voice demanded order, but none listened. The session was suspended.\n\n\n\n*\\[I have more in mind but this is already too long, tell me if you want a part 2\\]*",

      "title": "Equity Lifestyle Properties ($ELS) Reports Q3 2025 Earnings & Guidance",
      "selftext": "\n\n\n---\n\n## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n#### SEC Filing Analysis: EQUITY LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES INC (ELS)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: High\n- **Key Takeaway**: Equity Lifestyle Properties filed an 8-K to report its third-quarter 2025 financial results, showing a 4.6% year-over-year increase in Normalized FFO per share and providing guidance for the upcoming quarter and year.\n- **Market Impact**: As a primary financial disclosure, this earnings report and its accompanying guidance will be a key driver of the stock's performance and analyst ratings.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Company | EQUITY LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES INC |\n| Ticker Symbol | ELS |\n| CIK | 0000895417 |\n| Industry | REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Name | null |\n| CIK | null |\n| Title/Position | null |\n| Relationship | null |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Form Type | 8-K |\n| Transaction Date | 2025-10-22 |\n| Transaction Code | null |\n| Security Type | null |\n| Shares Involved | null |\n| Price Per Share | null |\n| Total Value | null |\n| Shares Owned After | null |\n| Ownership Type | null |\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\n#### Transaction Materiality\n\nThis filing is an 8-K for an earnings announcement, not an insider stock transaction. Therefore, transaction-specific materiality metrics are not applicable.\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Market Cap Context**: With a market capitalization of $12.19 billion, Equity Lifestyle Properties is a large-cap REIT. Its financial results and guidance are closely watched by the market.\n- **Significance of Filing**: An 8-K reporting quarterly results (Item 2.02) is a high-significance event. The reported Normalized FFO of $0.75 per share, a 4.6% increase from the prior year, and core revenue growth of 3.1% are key performance indicators for a REIT.\n- **Forward Guidance**: The company provided guidance for Q4 2025 (Normalized FFO of $0.75 to $0.81 per share) and preliminary 2026 rent rate growth assumptions (approx. 5.1%), which will heavily influence investor sentiment and valuation models.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Neutral to Positive\n- **Reasoning**: The reported year-over-year growth in FFO and revenues is a positive signal. The market's ultimate reaction will depend on how the results and, more importantly, the forward guidance compare to analyst expectations. The mention of a -40% seasonal reservation pace from Canadian customers could be a point of concern.\n\n#### Volume & Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: High. Earnings announcements typically lead to significantly increased trading volume as investors and algorithms react to the new information.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Bullish. The company reported continued strong performance and solid growth in key REIT metrics, which generally supports a positive market view.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- Consistent growth in Normalized FFO, a key metric for REITs.\n- Core property operating revenues and income are increasing.\n- The company is providing clear forward-looking guidance, including rent rate increase assumptions for 2026.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- The press release notes a significant slowdown in seasonal reservation pace from Canadian customers, which could impact future revenue.\n- As a REIT, the company is sensitive to changes in interest rates, which are mentioned as a risk factor.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Solid Performance**: ELS delivered a 4.6% increase in Normalized FFO per share for Q3 2025, meeting the midpoint of its guidance.\n2. **Strong Rent Growth**: The company anticipates average rent rate increases of approximately 5.1% for 2026, signaling confidence in its pricing power.\n3. **Identified Headwind**: A notable drop in seasonal reservations from Canadian customers presents a specific risk to short-term revenue growth.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\n#### Transaction Notes\n\n- **Filing Purpose**: This Form 8-K was filed under Item 2.02, \"Results of Operations and Financial Condition,\" and Item 9.01, \"Financial Statements and Exhibits.\"\n- **Content**: The filing's primary content is the press release (Exhibit 99.1) announcing the company's Q3 2025 financial results.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

      "title": "[PASS] Step 1 (30 Sept 2025) | IMG | 1 Year Prep (with Internship) | UWorld + Bootcamp + Anki + NBMEs 25–32",
      "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/z9o4qasr9vwf1.jpg?width=988&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b097f4934bb0910021a6e92f2873459b0bb430\n\nGot my result last week — PASS 🎉  \nWanted to give back to this community that helped me so much throughout my prep. Couldn’t have done it without this community.\n\n# 🩺 Background\n\nIMG.  \nStudied alongside the last 6 months of internship + 6 months of full-time prep after that.  \nTook Step 1 on **30 September 2025**.\n\n📚 **Resources Used**\n\n• **UWorld:**  \nSingle complete pass, system-wise + timed. Reviewed all explanations thoroughly and annotated in FA.  \nAnnotation took too long — wouldn’t recommend spending excessive time on it. What really helps is revisiting and reinforcing concepts multiple times.\n\n• **Theory:**  \nUsed Boards & Beyond and Bootcamp together.  \nBootcamp felt more engaging and active — would recommend it over B&B.\n\n• **Pathoma:**  \nCh. 1–3 in detail; re-watched weak topics (esp. heme, GI). Also used Duke’s Pathoma deck.\n\n• **Anki (AnKing):**  \nSelective use for weak systems. Highly recommended if you have enough time — this builds your main conceptual foundation, and with spaced repetition, it’s gold.\n\n• **Sketchy:**  \nMicro + Pharm consistently, using Pepper Deck.  \nRevised the deck around 10–15 times directly — didn’t watch the videos.\n\n• **Pixorize:**  \nBiochem, Immuno & Neuro — used only the decks, skipped the videos.\n\n• **Anatomy:**  \nIf weak, consider “100 Concepts in Anatomy” (PDF or Anki deck) — concise and efficient.\n\n• **Mehlman PDFs:**  \nFirst read after 3–4 NBMEs, second read a few days before Step 1.  \nMust-do sections: High-Yield Arrows, Risk Factors, and your weak systems (especially neuroanatomy).\n\n• **Biostats:**  \nRandy Neil videos are enough — no complex biostats on the actual exam.\n\n• **Bioethics:**  \nTwo Dirty Medicine videos (around 1 hour each).  \nExtremely helpful when you’re stuck between two close options.\n\n• **ChatGPT:**  \nCouldn’t have done it without it. Uploaded FA into projects, wrote a review algorithm, analyzed all my NBME questions, and clarified doubts through it.\n\n• **Last Day Review:**  \nMehlman 2nd reading, HY images, HY RF, Biostats, and Bioethics.\n\n# 📈 NBMEs / UWSA / Free 120\n\n|Date|Form|%|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|05 Jun|NBME 25|48%|\n|03 Jul|NBME 26|55%|\n|16 Jul|NBME 27|62%|\n|28 Jul|UWSA 1|50%|\n|12 Aug|NBME 28|57%|\n|31 Aug|NBME 29|70%|\n|06 Sep|NBME 30|63%|\n|16 Sep|NBME 31|73%|\n|22 Sep|Old Free 120|75%|\n|22 Sep|NBME 32|68%|\n|26 Sep|New Free 120|68%|\n\nAll NBMEs were done online. You’ll receive a detailed report card for each form — make full use of it. Focus on your weak topics from that report before taking the next NBME. If you consistently review and address those gaps, you’ll gradually see steady progress across forms.\n\n🧠 **Before the Exam**\n\nManaged about 4.5 hours of sleep the night before. Fixed my sleep schedule 7–8 days before (10 PM–6 AM), but still struggled due to anxiety. Took melatonin, which helped — I’d recommend keeping a backup sleep aid handy in case you can’t sleep the night before.\n\n🧾 **Exam Day Experience**\n\n* Difficulty close to newer NBMEs (30–32).\n* Pattern similar to Free 120.\n* Concepts were the same as NBME, but questions were phrased vaguely — focus on understanding, not memorization.\n* UWSA wasn’t useful — fine for practice, but not predictive and can lower confidence.\n\n**Question Style:**  \n3–4 ethics/biostats per block, rest integrated and second-order.  \nQuestion length similar to UWorld — if you can complete UWorld blocks 10 mins early, you’ll manage Step 1 on time.\n\n**Timing:**  \nFinished each block exactly on time; only managed to review one block.\n\n**Breaks:**  \nTook a short break after every block.  \nHad a cup of coffee before the exam, sipped Red Bull during breaks, and ate small bites of protein bars and a peanut butter sandwich.  \nTake food that’s quick and handy — you won’t have time for long meals.\n\n**Prometric Experience:**  \nSmooth overall.  \nDidn’t give Free 120 at Prometric beforehand — good decision, not worth the money.\n\n🔑 **Reflections & Key Takeaways**\n\n* UWorld explanations are gold — take your time to understand them.\n* NBMEs 29–32 + Free 120 reflect the real exam best.\n* Bootcamp and Sketchy help retention and reduce burnout.\n* One consistent pass of Anki is enough — no need to finish every subdeck.\n* Don’t rely too much on UWSA scores.\n* Protect your energy — 6 steady days a week > 7 burnt-out ones.\n* CONSISTENCY IS KEY.\n\n🧩 **Final Thoughts**\n\nIf you’re balancing internship or clinical work, steady consistency matters more than long hours. Master your question bank, track your NBME progress, and treat every low score as feedback — not failure.\n\nGood luck to everyone preparing. Happy to answer any questions! 🙌\n\nHope I’m not forgetting anything.",

      "selftext": "# Bovada Online Casino, Sportsbook, Poker, and Bonus Review\n\nBovada has been a cornerstone of the U.S. online gambling market since its inception in 2011, offering a comprehensive platform that combines a sportsbook, casino, poker room, and racebook. Known for its user-friendly interface, extensive betting options, and generous bonuses, Bovada has earned a reputation as a trusted destination for American bettors.\n\nReview of Bovada’s offerings across its sportsbook, casino, poker room, and bonus structures, while critically examining its strengths, weaknesses, and overall legitimacy. We’ll also address user experiences, banking options, customer service, and responsible gambling features to provide a holistic assessment of whether Bovada is the right choice for you in 2025.\n\n# About Bovada\n\nBovada emerged as the U.S.-facing arm of the Bodog brand, founded by Calvin Ayre in 2000. Operated by the Morris Mohawk Gaming Group and licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission in Canada, Bovada has navigated the complexities of U.S. gambling laws by operating offshore, serving players in 45 states (excluding Delaware, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York). Its longevity—over 14 years in a competitive industry—speaks to its reliability,\n\nBovada’s appeal lies in its all-in-one platform, catering to sports bettors, casino players, and poker players. With a sleek website, mobile compatibility, and cryptocurrency support, it prioritizes convenience and accessibility. However, its offshore status raises questions about regulation and safety, which we’ll explore. This review draws from extensive research, including user feedback, expert analyses, and Bovada’s official offerings, to deliver an objective evaluation.\n\n# Bovada Sportsbook: Features and Betting Options\n\nBovada’s sportsbook is its flagship product, renowned for its extensive coverage of North American sports like NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and UFC, alongside international markets such as soccer, tennis, golf, and esports. With over 30 sports and thousands of pre-game and live betting markets, Bovada caters to both casual and serious bettors. The platform’s intuitive design, featuring a clean interface and easy navigation, makes it accessible for newcomers while offering depth for experienced users.\n\n**Betting Markets: Bovada excels in its variety of betting options:**\n\n* Moneyline, Spread, and Totals: Standard bets are available across all major sports, with competitive odds. For example, NFL games often feature spreads within -110 to -120, aligning with industry standards.\n* Prop Bets: Bovada’s Prop Builder allows users to create custom prop bets, combining player or team stats into parlays. Examples include NBA player points, rebounds, or assists.\n* Parlays: The Parlay Booster enhances odds for pre-selected or custom parlays, popular among bettors chasing higher payouts.\n* Futures: Bets on season-long outcomes, like Super Bowl winners or NBA MVP, are robust, with early lines offering value.\n* Live Betting: In-play markets are a highlight, with real-time odds for soccer, basketball, and tennis. Bovada provides heatmaps and live stats, though it lacks live streaming, a notable drawback compared to competitors like Bet365.\n\n# Bovada Sportsbook Bonuses\n\n* [BV1000](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-sports-social) Sports Betting Bonus of 50% on 1st deposit up to $1,000. This is an EXCLUSIVE bonus, you must enter the promo code manually on your ***FIRST DEPOIST***.\n* [BTCSWB750](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-crypto) – Sports betting bonus code for deposit with Crypto. Get 75% match bonus up to $750, valid with a Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV Deposit. Rollover is 5X Sports.\n\n**Odds and Lines**\n\nBovada’s odds are competitive but not always the first out. Bookmaker & BetOnline are sometimes posted earlier. However, the platform’s popularity ensures high liquidity, reducing the risk of unfavorable line movements. Casual bettors benefit from Bovada’s focus on mainstream markets, while niche sports like darts or rugby offer decent value.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n* Wide Market Coverage: From major leagues to obscure events like Belarusian basketball, Bovada’s diversity is unmatched among offshore sportsbooks.\n* User-Friendly Interface: The sportsbook’s layout, with live odds prominently displayed, simplifies betting.\n* Customizable Bets: Prop Builder and Parlay Booster add creativity and value.\n* Crypto Bonuses: A 75% match up to $750 for crypto deposits (code BTCSWB750) enhances sports betting funds.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n* Late Lines: Sharp bettors criticize delayed line releases, limiting early value.\n* No Live Streaming: Unlike Bet365 or DraftKings, Bovada lacks video streams, relying on stats and visualizations.\n\n**Bovada Sportsbook Conclusion**\n\nBovada’s sportsbook is ideal for casual bettors and those seeking variety, particularly in North American sports. Its live betting platform and custom bet features are innovative, but the absence of streaming hinder its appeal for some players. The crypto bonus adds significant value, making it a strong choice for U.S. players outside regulated states.\n\n# Bovada Casino: Games and Features\n\nBovada’s casino section, powered by providers like RealTime Gaming, Rival, Betsoft, and Woohoo, offers over 300 games, including slots, table games, video poker, and live dealer options. While smaller than some competitors’ libraries (e.g., Ignition Casinos 1,000+ titles), Bovada’s casino is tailored for U.S. players, emphasizing quality and accessibility. The platform’s no-download interface and mobile compatibility ensure seamless play across devices.\n\n**Game Selection**\n\n* Slots: With 200+ titles, slots dominate, featuring high-volatility games like Golden Buffalo and progressive jackpots like Shopping Spree (payouts exceeding $1 million). Slots contribute 100% to bonus wagering, making them ideal for clearing promotions. Popular titles include A Night With Cleo and Reels and Wheels XL.\n* Table Games: Bovada offers multiple variants of blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and poker, including Classic Blackjack (3:2 payouts) and European Roulette. Unique games like Andar Bahar add variety, though the selection (around 30 titles) is modest.\n* Video Poker: 17 options, such as Deuces Wild and Joker Poker, cater to strategy-focused players, with RTPs often exceeding 99%.\n* Live Dealer: Live blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and Super 6 tables provide an immersive experience, with stakes ranging from $5 to $5,000. However, live games don’t contribute to bonus rollovers.\n* Specialty Games: Keno, bingo, and scratch cards round out the library, offering low-stakes entertainment.\n\n# Bovada Casino Bonuses\n\nThe casino welcome bonus is a standout, offering a 100% match up to $1,000 on the first three deposits (totaling $3,000) with code NEWWELCOME. Crypto users can claim a 125% match up to $1,250 per deposit ($3,750 total). Rollover requirements are 25x for slots (reasonable) but 50x for table games, which is steep. Slots are the best choice for clearing bonuses due to their 100% contribution rate.\n\n**Bovada Casino Bonus Codes**\n\n* [CAWELCOME](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) — First-time players can get a 100% match deposit bonus (up to $1,000)\n* [BV2NDCWB](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) — Earn a 100% match deposit bonus (up to $1,000) on your second and third deposits\n* [BTCCWB1250](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-crypto) — Bitcoin users will receive a 125% first-time deposit bonus (up to $1,250)\n* [BTC2NDWB ](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-crypto)— Get a bonus (125% up to $1,250) on your second and third Bitcoin deposits\n* [BIGLEAGUES](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) \\- No deposit bonus code, you ***get 25 free spins*** on the slot game 777 Deluxe\n\nStrengths\n\n* Generous Welcome Bonus: Up to $3,750 in crypto bonuses is among the best for U.S.-facing casinos.\n* Mobile Compatibility: The browser-based platform works flawlessly on iOS and Android.\n* Progressive Jackpots: Games like Aztec’s Millions offer life-changing payouts.\n* Live Dealer Quality: Professional dealers and HD streams enhance the experience.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n* Limited Game Library: 300+ games pale compared to regulated casinos like Caesars.\n* High Table Game Rollovers: 50x requirements deter table game players.\n\n**Bovada Casino Conclusion**\n\nBovada’s casino is a solid option for slot enthusiasts and live dealer fans, with generous bonuses and a user-friendly interface. However, its limited game count and high rollover requirements for table games may disappoint strategic players. The crypto bonus and progressive jackpots make it appealing for those chasing big wins.\n\n# Bovada Poker Room: Tournaments and Features\n\nBovada’s poker room, part of the PaiWangLuo Network, is the largest online poker platform for U.S. players, sharing traffic with Ignition Casino and Bodog. It offers Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and Omaha Hi/Lo in cash games, tournaments, and sit-and-go formats. Known for its amateur-friendly environment, Bovada attracts recreational players with features like anonymous tables and restricted third-party software.\n\n**Game Formats**\n\n* Cash Games: Stakes range from $0.02/$0.05 to $10/$20, with full-ring and short-handed tables. Zone Poker, a fast-fold variant, moves players to new tables after folding, maximizing hands per hour.\n* Tournaments: Weekly prize pools exceed $2 million, with buy-ins from $1 to $450. Highlights include the Lucky Sevens Tournament ($7,777 prize pool, $22 buy-in) and $400,000 guaranteed events.\n* Sit-and-Go: Options include Jackpot SNGs and satellites, catering to various bankrolls.\n* Unique Features: Anonymous tables prevent player tracking, leveling the playing field. The Bad Beat Bonus (up to $1,000 for losing with aces full of kings or better) and Royal Flush Bonus ($200) add excitement.\n\n# Bovada Poker Bonuses\n\nNew poker players can claim a 100% match up to $500 with code PWB500. The bonus is released in $5 increments for every 150 Rewards Points earned, with a 30-day clearing period. Rakeback reaches up to 70% during clearance, but no ongoing rakeback exists post-bonus, a drawback for grinders.\n\n**Bovada Poker Bonus Code**\n\n* [PWB500](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada%20poker) — poker players get a 100% match deposit bonus up to $500 on their first deposit\n\nStrengths\n\n* High Traffic: Constant action across stakes ensures quick game starts.\n* Amateur-Friendly: Anonymous tables and software restrictions deter pros, benefiting casual players.\n* Tournament Variety: Over $2 million in weekly guarantees is unmatched for U.S. poker.\n* Mobile App: A dedicated poker app for iOS and Android enhances portability.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n* No Rakeback Post-Bonus: Pros find limited long-term value.\n* 30-Day Bonus Clearance: Casual players may struggle to unlock the full $500.\n* Restricted Software: HUDs and trackers are banned, frustrating advanced players.\n\n**Bovada Poker Room Conclusion**\n\nBovada’s poker room is a haven for recreational players, with high traffic, anonymous tables, and substantial tournament prize pools. The welcome bonus is generous, but the lack of ongoing rakeback and software restrictions may deter professionals. It’s an excellent choice for casual or mid-stakes players seeking a vibrant U.S. poker scene.\n\n# Bovada Bonuses and Promotions\n\nBovada’s bonus structure is tailored to its three main sections, with enhanced rewards for cryptocurrency deposits:\n\n* Sportsbook:\n   * Standard: 50% match up to $250 (code BV1000, 5x rollover).\n   * Crypto: 75% match up to $750 (code BTCSWB750, 5x rollover).\n* Casino:\n   * Standard: 100% match up to $1,000 on first three deposits ($3,000 total, code NEWWELCOME, 25x rollover for slots).\n   * Crypto: 125% match up to $1,250 per deposit ($3,750 total, same terms).\n* Poker: 100% match up to $500 (code PWB500, cleared via Rewards Points, 30-day window).\n* Racebook: Horse racing bets earn 40–60 points per $1, with no specific welcome bonus but integrated into Rewards Program.\n\n**Ongoing Promotions**\n\n* Refer-a-Friend: Earn 200% of a friend’s first deposit up to $200, plus $75 if they deposit with crypto (unlimited referrals).\n* Bovada Rewards Program: Automatically enrolled, players earn points across all betting activities (15 points per $1 on sports parlays, 3 points per $1 on slots).

However, the table game requirements may deter some players. The referral program and tiered rewards add long-term value, making Bovada competitive for U.S. bettors.\n\n# Banking Options and Payouts\n\nDeposits\n\n* Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano. No fees, instant processing, $10–$5,000 limits.\n* Credit/Debit Cards: Visa, Mastercard, American Express. 5.9–15.9% fees, $20–$1,500 limits.\n* Other: MatchPay (via Cash App, Venmo, Zelle), bank transfers, vouchers.

However, high credit card fees and withdrawal costs for non-crypto users are significant drawbacks. Crypto is the clear choice for optimal banking efficiency.\n\n# Bovada Safety, Legitimacy, and Customer Service\n\n**Legitimacy**\n\nBovada operates under a Kahnawake Gaming Commission license, ensuring oversight but not U.S. state regulation. Its SSL encryption and random number generators (verified by third parties) promote fairness. User reviews are mixed: many praise Bovada’s reliability. Casinomeister reports only three player disputes in four years, suggesting strong resolution practices.\n\n**Safety**\n\n* Encryption: 256-bit SSL protects transactions and data.\n* Responsible Gambling: Tools include deposit limits, self-exclusion, and links to Gamblers Anonymous. However, responsible gambling resources are less robust than at regulated sites.\n* Account Security: Two-factor authentication and anonymous poker tables enhance user protection.\n\n**Customer Service**\n\n* Channels: 24/7 support via email, phone, and a detailed FAQ. No live chat is a notable omission.\n* Response Time: Email responses take 12–24 hours; phone support is prompt in resolving complex issues.\n* User Feedback: FAQs are comprehensive.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n* Longevity: Over a decade of operation builds trust.\n* Encryption: Industry-standard security protects users.\n* Dispute Resolution: Low complaint volume suggests effective handling.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n* No Live Chat: Delays resolution compared to competitors.\n* Payout Complaints: Non crypto withdrawals take longer than crypto.\n\n**Bovada Customer Service Conclusion**\n\nBovada is a safe and legitimate, with strong security and a long track record. Customer service is adequate but lags behind some platforms due to the absence of live chat.User\n\n# Experience and Mobile Compatibility\n\nBovada’s website is minimalist, with a grey, white, and red color scheme that prioritizes readability. The top navigation bar allows quick switches between sports, casino, poker, and racebook sections. Page load times are fast, even on slower connections, and live betting markets are prominently displayed. The dashboard tracks bets, bonuses, and account activity seamlessly.\n\n**Bovada Mobile App**\n\nBovada’s browser-based platform is fully optimized for iOS and Android, requiring no app download for sports or casino play. The poker room offers a dedicated app, enhancing portability. Mobile navigation mirrors the desktop experience, with responsive design ensuring smooth betting and gaming. However, the lack of a unified app for all sections is a minor inconvenience.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n* Intuitive Design: Easy navigation suits beginners and veterans.\n* Fast Performance: Optimized for low-bandwidth connections.\n* Mobile Poker App: Dedicated app adds value for poker players.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n* No Unified App: Separate poker app fragments the experience.\n* Basic Aesthetics: Interface lacks the polish of BetOnline.\n\n**Bovada Experience Conclusion**\n\nBovada’s user experience is excellent, with a functional website and robust mobile compatibility. The poker app is a highlight, but a unified app would streamline access. The platform’s simplicity ensures accessibility across skill levels.\n\n# Responsible Gambling and Community Engagement\n\nBovada provides responsible gambling tools, including:\n\n* Deposit Limits: Daily, weekly, or monthly caps.\n* Self-Exclusion: Temporary or permanent account suspension.\n* Resources: Links to Gamblers Anonymous and responsible gambling guides.\n\nBovada Hub page with sports betting tips, poker strategies, and casino news. Social media presence is minimal, with occasional promotional posts.\n\n# Bovada Market Position In 2025\n\nBovada remains a top offshore choice for U.S. bettors, particularly in unregulated states. Its all-in-one platform, crypto focus, and generous bonuses maintain its edge, over regulated sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings. Bovada’s decision to exit markets like Michigan and Colorado reflects regulatory pressures, signaling a shrinking footprint as U.S. legalization expands.\n\n**Innovations**\n\n* Mega Scratch Card: A 2024 addition rewarding casino and poker players with daily points.\n* Prop Builder Expansion: Enhanced customization for NBA and EPL matches.\n* Crypto Expansion: Support for 10+ cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, positions Bovada as a crypto-friendly platform.\n\n**Challenges**\n\n* Fewer States: Bovada has chosen to lose some markets in the United States.\n* Limited Promotions: Fewer reload bonuses compared to BetOnline or BetUS.\n\n# Bovada 2025 Conclusion\n\nBovada is a premier online gambling destination for U.S. players, excelling in its comprehensive sportsbook, user-friendly casino, and generous crypto bonuses. Its poker room is unmatched in the U.S., and the Rewards Program adds long-term value.\n\n**Strengths include:**\n\n* Versatility: Sports, casino, poker, and racebook under one platform.\n* Crypto Support: Fast, secure, and bonus-enhanced transactions.\n* Accessibility: Intuitive design and mobile compatibility.\n* Bonuses: Up to $3,750 in casino funds and low sports rollovers.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* Payout Delays: Non-crypto withdrawals take longer than cyrpto.\n* Limited Regulation: Offshore status reduces legal protections.\n* Promotional Gaps: No live streaming.\n\nFor casual bettors, bettors, casual casino players, and poker enthusiasts in unregulated states, Bovada is highly recommended, particularly for crypto users.\n\nSharp bettors and those in regulated markets may prefer Bookmaker or BetOnline for better odds, streaming, and faster payouts.\n\nResponsible Gambling: Call 1-800-GAMBLER or visit [www.1800gambler.net](http://www.1800gambler.net/) for support.\n\nAlways gamble responsibly.\n\n# Best Bovada Bonus Codes\n\n* [PWB500](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada%20poker) \\- Poker Bonus Code **Poker** players get a ***100% match*** deposit bonus up to $500 on their first deposit\n* [BTCSWB750](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-promotions) \\- Crypto **Sports** Bonus Code Bitcoin users will receive a **75%** first-time deposit bonus (to $750)\n* [BTCCWB1250](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-promotions) \\- **Casino** **Crypto** Bonus Code Bitcoin users will receive a **125%** first-time deposit bonus (up to $1,250)\n* [BIGLEAGUES](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) \\- **Casino** FREE Spin Bonus Code No deposit bonus code, you ***get 25 free spins***\n* [CAWELCOME](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) \\- **Casino** Bonus Code First-time players can get a **100% match** deposit bonus (up to $1,000)\n\n# Bovada Casino Bonus Codes\n\n* [CAWELCOME](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) — First-time players can get a 100% match deposit bonus (up to $1,000)\n* [BV2NDCWB](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) — Earn a 100% match deposit bonus (up to $1,000) on your second and third deposits\n* [BTCCWB1250](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-crypto) — Bitcoin users will receive a 125% first-time deposit bonus (up to $1,250)\n* [BTC2NDWB ](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-crypto)— Get a bonus (125% up to $1,250) on your second and third Bitcoin deposits\n* [BIGLEAGUES](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-casino) \\- No deposit bonus code, you ***get 25 free spins*** on the slot game 777 Deluxe\n\n# Bovada Sports Betting Bonus Codes\n\n* [BV1000](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-sports-social) Sports Betting Bonus of 50% on 1st deposit up to $1,000\n* [BTCSWB750](https://xsportsbook.com/bovada-crypto) – Sports betting bonus code for deposit with Crypto.

      "selftext": "Markets are mostly flat this morning. $GLD is trying to reclaim the mentioned TRL around 380 after slipping below it earlier this week. $TLT is gapping down and moving further away from the 92 key resistance area, though the initial reaction to that level was muted. $TSLA remains rangebound and pinned near the previous key level at 425. It might get interesting if it dips below 411.50, where buyers previously defended aggressively.\n\nInteresting movers:\n\n$IBM beat estimates by $0.20 with EPS of $2.65 on revenue of $16.33B, up 9% year over year. Software rose 10% with automation up 24% and hybrid cloud up 14%, while infrastructure climbed 17% driven by a 61% jump in Z systems. The company raised its FY25 outlook, now guiding for revenue growth above 5% in constant currency and free cash flow of about $14B. Operating pre-tax margin expanded 130 bps through the first nine months, and management expects further improvement in Q4 supported by Z17 demand and a modest recovery in consulting. Key support area is at 265.75, watch if it holds.\n\n$QS reported a quarterly loss of $0.18 per share, beating estimates by $0.02, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $61.4M in line with expectations. The company began shipping Cobra-based QSE-5 B1 samples under its Ducati program, marking a key 2025 milestone. Management reiterated a full-year adjusted EBITDA loss of $245M–$260M and capex of $30M–$40M, noting its cash runway now extends through the end of the decade. Stock is back above 15, watch if it can hold above.\n\n$LVS posted EPS of $0.78, beating estimates by $0.16 on revenue of $3.33B, up 24% year over year. Adjusted property EBITDA rose to $1.34B from $991M, supported by steady performance in both Macao and Singapore. Mass market revenue in Macao reached 25.4%, while Marina Bay Sands maintained a 51.7% EBITDA margin and is expected to exceed $2.5B in 2025. The board raised the dividend to $0.30 per share and expanded its buyback authorization to $2B. Watch how it handles 54.\n\n$HON delivered EPS of $2.82, beating estimates by $0.25 on revenue of $10.41B, up 7% year over year. Orders rose 22%, led by Aerospace Technologies and Energy and Sustainability Solutions. The company guided FY25 EPS to $10.60–$10.70, slightly above consensus, on revenue of $40.7B–$40.9B, roughly in line. Guidance factors in the Solstice Advanced Materials spin-off, which will trim full-year sales by $0.7B and EPS by $0.21. 216 and 220 are key resistance areas to watch.

      "selftext": "\n\n\n---\n\n## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n#### SEC Filing Analysis: TRACTOR SUPPLY CO /DE/ (TSCO)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: High\n- **Key Takeaway**: Tractor Supply reported strong Q3 2025 results with a 7.2% increase in net sales and narrowed its full-year guidance, signaling increased confidence in its business outlook. The company also executed a $75.4 million share buyback.\n- **Market Impact**: The filing is expected to have a positive market impact, as the solid earnings and tightened guidance reduce investor uncertainty.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Company | TRACTOR SUPPLY CO /DE/ |\n| Ticker Symbol | TSCO |\n| CIK | 0000916365 |\n| Industry | RETAIL-BUILDING MATERIALS, HARDWARE, GARDEN SUPPLY |\n\n#### Filing Details\n\nThis is a Form 8-K Current Report, not an insider trading filing. It discloses material information related to the company's financial performance.\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Form Type | 8-K |\n| Filing Date | 2025-10-23 |\n| Period of Report | 2025-10-23 |\n| Items Reported | 2.02 (Results of Operations), 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits) |\n\n#### Q3 2025 Earnings Highlights\n\n| Metric | Q3 2025 Result | Year-over-Year Change |\n|---|---|---|\n| Net Sales | $3.72 Billion | +7.2% |\n| Comparable Store Sales | +3.9% | N/A |\n| Diluted EPS | $0.49 | +8.6% |\n| Operating Income | $342.7 Million | +5.6% |\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\nThe filing details a corporate share repurchase program, not an individual insider trade. \n\n#### Corporate Buyback Materiality\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Transaction Value | $75,400,000 |\n| % of Market Cap | 0.26% |\n| Shares Transacted | 1,300,000 |\n| % of Shares Outstanding | 0.25% |\n| Materiality Assessment | **Moderate**. While not meeting the 'High Significance' threshold, a buyback of this size is a notable capital allocation decision. |\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Market Cap Context**: For a company with a $29.30 billion market capitalization, the $75.4 million buyback is a moderately sized action. It represents a tangible return of capital to shareholders and a reduction in the total share count.\n- **Ownership Concentration**: The buyback slightly increases the ownership percentage of all remaining shareholders by reducing the total number of shares outstanding.\n- **Transaction Significance**: The repurchase of 0.25% of the company's outstanding shares in a single quarter is a meaningful use of capital, signaling management's belief that the stock is a good investment.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Positive\n- **Reasoning**: The combination of beating sales expectations, demonstrating strong comparable store sales growth, and narrowing full-year guidance upwards is typically viewed favorably by the market. The share buyback provides an additional layer of positive sentiment.\n\n#### Volume & Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: High. Earnings reports are major catalysts for trading volume as institutions and retail investors react to the new information.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Bullish. The report indicates the company is executing well and is confident in its near-term future.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- **Strong Sales Growth**: A 7.2% increase in net sales to a record $3.72 billion shows robust consumer demand.\n- **Guidance Confidence**: Narrowing the guidance range for FY2025 suggests management has better visibility and confidence in its ability to hit its targets.\n- **Capital Return**: The $75.4 million share repurchase demonstrates a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and signals management's belief in the company's value.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- **Macroeconomic Pressures**: The filing notes that the business is subject to macroeconomic pressures, which remain a background risk for any retailer.\n- **Cost Pressures**: The report mentions that gross margin improvement was partially offset by tariff and transportation costs, indicating ongoing cost management challenges.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. Tractor Supply's business model remains resilient, with strong growth in sales and comparable store performance.\n2. Management is actively returning capital to shareholders through dividends and a moderately significant share buyback program.\n3. The company has provided a clearer, more confident outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, reducing uncertainty for investors.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

The market will likely focus on the strong revenue and positive guidance, potentially offsetting the reported net loss.\n\n#### Filing Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Company | American Airlines Group Inc. |\n| Ticker Symbol | AAL |\n| CIK | 0000006201 |\n| Form Type | 8-K |\n| Filing Date | 2025-10-23 |\n| Period of Report | 2025-10-23 |\n\n#### Event Summary\n\nThe Form 8-K was filed to report the company's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, and to provide forward-looking guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2025.\n\n#### Financial Highlights (Q3 2025)\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Total Operating Revenues | $13.7 billion |\n| Operating Income | $151 million |\n| Net Loss | -$114 million |\n| Diluted Loss Per Share | -$0.17 |\n| Adjusted Net Loss (Excluding Special Items) | -$111 million |\n| Adjusted Loss Per Share | -$0.17 |\n\n#### Forward-Looking Guidance\n\n| Metric | Q4 2025 Estimate | Full Year 2025 Estimate |\n|---|---|---|\n| Total Capacity (vs. 2024) | ~+3.0% to +5.0% | Not Specified |\n| Total Revenue (vs. 2024) | ~+3.0% to +5.0% | Not Specified |\n| Adjusted Operating Margin | ~5.0% to 7.0% | Not Specified |\n| Adjusted EPS | $0.45 to $0.75 | $0.65 to $0.95 |\n| Free Cash Flow | Not Specified | Over $1 billion |\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Revenue Performance**: Achieving record third-quarter revenue of $13.7 billion demonstrates robust demand for travel and strong operational capacity. This is a significant positive indicator for the airline industry's health.\n- **Profitability**: The company reported a GAAP net loss of $114 million. While a loss is negative, the forward guidance for adjusted EPS to be between $0.65 and $0.95 for the full year suggests management's confidence in a profitable fourth quarter to turn the year positive on an adjusted basis.\n- **Balance Sheet**: The company highlighted its focus on strengthening the balance sheet, reducing total debt by $1.2 billion in the quarter. The expectation of over $1 billion in free cash flow for the full year is a key metric for investors, indicating the company's ability to generate cash after capital expenditures.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Neutral to Positive\n- **Reasoning**: While the Q3 net loss is a headwind, the market is forward-looking.

The combination of stable earnings and a substantial buyback is generally viewed as a positive signal.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Company | POPULAR, INC. |\n| Ticker Symbol | BPOP |\n| CIK | 0000763901 |\n| Industry | STATE COMMERCIAL BANKS |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Name | null |\n| CIK | null |\n| Title/Position | null |\n| Relationship | null |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\nThis filing is a Form 8-K for an earnings release and does not contain insider transaction data.

This demonstrates management's confidence in the company's valuation and commitment to enhancing shareholder value.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Positive\n- **Reasoning**: The earnings report shows stable financial performance with a slight beat on EPS.

This is a key area for investors to monitor.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. Popular, Inc. delivered solid Q3 2025 results with stable net income and growing EPS.\n2. The company is actively returning capital to shareholders through a significant buyback program and an increased dividend.\n3. While overall performance is strong, a notable increase in non-performing loans warrants investor attention.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\n#### Transaction Notes\n\n- The filing is a standard Form 8-K used to announce material corporate events, in this case, the quarterly financial results for the period ending September 30, 2025.\n- The report includes Exhibit 99.1 (Press Release) and Exhibit 99.2 (Conference Call Presentation), which provide detailed financial data and management commentary.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

However, investors should note the marked increase in leverage and negative equity, the volatility of key revenue streams (contingent commissions), and recent declines in NPS and franchise count. The company’s approach to capital returns remains aggressive, highlighted by large buybacks and a sizable special distribution. The franchise growth model is delivering revenue and policy expansion, but close attention to customer retention, operational discipline, and franchise sustainability is warranted going forward.\n\nVisit [Publicview AI](https://www.publicview.ai/chat) to search and analyze millions of SEC filings using AI.",

      "selftext": "Is The Pets Table a Threat To Butternut Box | B Corp & The Farmer's Dog?\n\nThere are businesses that transform industries, are hugely disruptive and incredibly popular with consumers, yet turn out to be pretty shit for shareholders. \n\nOne example is airlines, and DTC dog food delivery is as shit as it comes when it comes to business model. \n\nInsane churn, ever fickle CACs & the sheer reliance on tech to be close to the consumer are the key factors behind these lousy business models. \n\nAre they great? Yeah. Are they successful? Hell yeah, they are disrupting everything (including themselves). \n\nAre they making money? 😂 Lol, of course they are not. \n\nTake a look at HelloFresh's accounts. They turn over billions of dollars selling meat and potatoes, but they do not generate any profit. \n\nTheir share price says it all really. \n\nThis is why I can't fathom why some people who are much more intelligent than me want an equity stake in such businesses. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong? Or maybe I can actually read accounts? \n\nI made a video about the topic, you can find it in the comments.",

      "title": "Announcement For Those Who Are About To Struggle Without SNAP",
      "selftext": "I have made a comment on a few posts regarding this program, but I figure maming a post about it here will get better reach for everyone who might need it. There is some hope, at the very least for Medicaid/Medicare recipients. If you don't currently have Medicaid/Medicare but qualify for food stamps, you may want to apply for government insurance, at least for the time being while the government is shut down.\n\nI've attached some details that some of you may already be aware of that was provided to me through the Propel app. Maybe this will help add clarity to the conflicting information some (including myself) have been given about what exactly this shutdown means.\n\nI've also provided a resource (photos 8-20) to help us all get by while we aren't getting our stamps, which is covered by your state insurance in 48 states. I'm surprised not a lot of people know about this, even my own doctors were familiar with the program. They are medically tailored as well, so if you're worried about specific dietary restrictions for a chronic condition, you might request the appropriate specialized menu (they have 9, all of which I provided in the photos above). \n\nI'm a single mom, and I qualified for 14 free meals each week for my 9yo son and I. I think I only received them for 9 weeks, but it is better than nothing and it helped immensely when eggs were $10/dozen and my son was home all day for the summer and wasn't receiving school-provided free breakfasts. Their meals aren't half bad honestly, it did take a few weeks to try all the meals we were interested in to find what we liked most, and then we just got the same things every week – mostly breakfast foods so he could have eggs and pancakes etc without the hassle of cooking it and/or paying an egregious amount for eggs at the grocery store every week. They're shipped right to your door each week like a HelloFresh meal kit, but with the preparation and ease of Factor Meals. They're fresh, not frozen, but you can store them in the freezer for longevity and they last about two weeks in the fridge, and they handle all the insurance B.S. for you so you don't have to.\n\nGood luck everyone 🫶🏻",
