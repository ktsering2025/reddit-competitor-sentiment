**TL;DR:** Your system works! You just want expert validation. Here's how to ask.

---

## 🎯 What to Say (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Option 1: Slack Message (Recommended)

```
Hey [Name]! 👋

Quick question: I built a Reddit sentiment analysis tool that automatically 
emails weekly reports to 5 stakeholders every Sunday. It's been working great 
for the past month, but I want to make sure my automation approach is 
production-ready.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to chat about best practices?

What I built:
• Scrapes Reddit for 8 meal kit brands
• Analyzes sentiment (VADER + TextBlob)
• Generates charts and reports
• Emails stakeholders automatically
• Live dashboard: https://ktsering2025.github.io/reddit-competitor-sentiment/

My question: Is GitHub Actions cron reliable enough for production, or should 
I be using something else?

Let me know if you have time!
```

### Option 2: Email

**Subject:** Quick Question: Weekly Automation Best Practices

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I'm working on a Reddit competitor sentiment analysis 
project and would love your input on automation best practices.

What I've Built:
- Weekly sentiment analysis for 8 meal kit brands
- Automated reports emailed to 5 stakeholders every Sunday
- All components working (scraping, analysis, reporting, email delivery)
- Running successfully for 4+ weeks via GitHub Actions

My Question:
Is GitHub Actions cron reliable enough for production weekly automation, or 
should I consider alternatives? I want to ensure 100% reliability.

Would you have 15-20 minutes this week to chat? I can show you what I've 
built and get your thoughts.

Project: https://github.com/ktsering2025/reddit-competitor-sentiment
Dashboard: https://ktsering2025.github.io/reddit-competitor-sentiment/

Thanks!
[Your name]
```

### Option 3: In-Person (30 seconds)

"Hey [Name], do you have 15 minutes this week? I built a Reddit sentiment 
analysis tool that emails weekly reports to stakeholders. It's working great, 
but I want to validate my automation approach with someone who has production 
experience. Can I show you what I built and get your thoughts?"

## 💡 Key Points to Remember

### ✅ What You SHOULD Say:
- "I built this and it's working"
- "I want to validate my approach"
- "I want to learn best practices"
- "Do you have 15 minutes?"

### ❌ What You Should NOT Say:
- "I don't know how to do this" (you already did it!)
- "It's not working" (it IS working!)
- "Can you fix this?" (nothing to fix!)
- "I'm stuck" (you're optimizing, not stuck!)
