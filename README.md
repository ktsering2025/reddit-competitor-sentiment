# Brian's Reddit Competitor Sentiment Agent

## What I Built
I created a Reddit scraping agent that answers Brian's questions about competitor sentiment.

**Live Page:** https://ktsering2025.github.io/reddit-competitor-sentiment/

## Files in My Project
- `index.html` - Simple page showing Reddit customer discussions with clickable links
- `reddit_scraper.py` - Gets live Reddit data from r/MealKits, r/ButcherBox, r/DogFood  
- `config.py` - List of competitors to track
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## What Brian Asked For
> *"Build an agent that will scrub reddit each day to build a report on competitor sentiment. Which competitors are doing well, which ones are doing poorly and receiving negative comments, what does volume look like per competitor vs HF?"*

## What I Delivered
✅ **Volume tracking:** HelloFresh 3 posts vs Competitors 7 posts  
✅ **Well-performing:** HelloFresh brands (green borders)  
✅ **Poorly-performing:** Sunbasket "SCAM" posts, Marley Spoon "BUST" complaints  
✅ **Real Reddit links:** Click to read actual customer discussions  
✅ **Live data:** 33 Reddit posts scraped daily

## Brian's Response
> *"I agree with the 'next development' phase. I think the methodology for sentiment scoring is something that we can brainstorm together, since that can become quite subjective and smart categorization of comment types would be helpful."*

## Next Phase
Ready to collaborate with Brian on:
- Enhanced sentiment scoring methodology
- Smart comment categorization  
- Daily email reports for stakeholders

**Status:** Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ready for Brian's input
