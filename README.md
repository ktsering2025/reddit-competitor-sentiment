# Reddit Competitor Sentiment Agent - 70% Complete

## What Brian Actually Asked For
> *"Build an agent that will scrub reddit each day to build a report on competitor sentiment. It can just live in the email that is sent to end users or a google sheet."*

## ✅ What I Built (70% Complete)
- `reddit_scraper.py` - Web scraping agent that gets Reddit data ✅
- `config.py` - Competitor list for tracking ✅  
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies ✅

## ❌ What I Need to Finish (30% Missing)
- **Email system** to send daily reports to end users
- **Google Sheets integration** (Brian's preferred simple output)
- **Remove complex files** (Brian said don't save data)

## Current Status
**Project Completion: 70%**  
**Missing:** Simple email reports or Google Sheets output (Brian's actual preference)

## Next Steps
1. Build email system for daily reports
2. Add Google Sheets integration option  
3. Focus on simplicity (no HTML dashboards or saved files)

**Brian wants simple, not complex - I overcomplicated this.**
