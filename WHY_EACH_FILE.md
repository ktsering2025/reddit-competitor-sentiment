# File Purpose Explanation for Brian's Project

## Essential Files (What Brian Actually Needs)

### `reddit_scraper.py` - CORE REQUIREMENT
**Purpose:** Web scrapes Reddit daily to find competitor sentiment  
**Why needed:** Brian's main request - "build an agent that will scrub reddit each day"  
**Status:** Working - finds competitor mentions across Reddit  
**Next step:** Connect to email delivery system  

### `config.py` - COMPETITOR DATABASE  
**Purpose:** Lists all competitors to track (HelloFresh vs external)  
**Why needed:** Tells scraper which companies to look for  
**Based on:** Brian's August 2025 Market Insights resource  
**Status:** Complete competitor mapping  

### `requirements.txt` - DEPENDENCIES  
**Purpose:** Python packages needed to run the scraper  
**Why needed:** BeautifulSoup, requests for web scraping  
**Status:** All dependencies listed  

### `README.md` - PROJECT STATUS  
**Purpose:** Shows Brian current progress (70% complete)  
**Why needed:** Clear communication of what's built vs missing  
**Status:** Updated with honest assessment  

### `BRIAN_STATUS_UPDATE.md` - ALIGNMENT DOCUMENT  
**Purpose:** Detailed status and questions for Brian  
**Why needed:** Get Brian's input on email format, recipients, timing  
**Status:** 10 questions ready for Brian's feedback  

## Hidden Files (Not What Brian Asked For, Just for me to see overall data from Insights.pdf slide) 

### `charts/` folder - UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY  
**What it is:** Complex visualizations and market analysis charts  
**Why hidden:** Brian wants simple email/Google Sheets, not dashboards  
**Status:** Hidden via .gitignore - focus on simplicity  

### `reports/` folder - SAVED DATA FILES  
**What it is:** Generated data files from scraping  
**Why hidden:** Brian said "doesn't necessarily have to save the information"  
**Status:** Hidden - data should live in email/Google Sheets instead  

### `venv/` folder - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT  
**What it is:** Python virtual environment for development  
**Why hidden:** Local development tool, not needed for Brian's project  
**Status:** Hidden - not relevant to business requirements  

## Missing (30% to Complete)

### Email Delivery System - BRIAN'S PREFERENCE  
**What's needed:** Send daily competitor sentiment via email  
**Why important:** Brian specifically mentioned "email that is sent to end users"  
**Status:** Need to build - tomorrow's focus  

### Google Sheets Integration - ALTERNATIVE OUTPUT  
**What's needed:** Simple spreadsheet with competitor data  
**Why important:** Brian mentioned as alternative to email  
**Status:** Need to build - simpler than complex dashboards  

## Bottom Line for Brian
**Keep:** reddit_scraper.py, config.py, requirements.txt  
**Hide:** Complex visualizations, saved files, dashboards  
**Build:** Simple email delivery system (your actual preference)  

Focus on simplicity - you want actionable intelligence, not complex technical files.
