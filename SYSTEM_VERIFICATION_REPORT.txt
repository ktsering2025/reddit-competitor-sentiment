REDDIT COMPETITOR SENTIMENT SYSTEM - FINAL VERIFICATION REPORT
================================================================================
Generated: $(date)
Commit: $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
Project: Brian's Reddit Competitor Sentiment Analysis
================================================================================

A) DATA ACQUISITION AND SCRAPER TOOL
================================================================================

1. PRIMARY PYTHON LIBRARIES:
   - PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) - Line 7: import praw
   - requests + BeautifulSoup - Line 10: import requests
   
   Strategy: PRAW for authenticated API access, web scraping as fallback

2. SCRAPING STRATEGY:
   Location: accurate_scraper.py, lines 206-280
   Method: scrape_weekly_data()
   
   Key Logic:
   - Iterates over ALL_COMPETITORS (8 brands)
   - Each brand has 2-5 search URLs in WEEKLY_LINKS
   - Applies 7-day rolling window filter (start_time to end_time)
   - Deduplicates posts by URL
   - Rate limiting: 1 second between requests

================================================================================
B) SENTIMENT AND ACCURACY LOGIC
================================================================================

1. SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY (lines 762-795):

   ORDER OF CHECKS (if/elif chain):
   
   1. has_strong_negative → NEGATIVE
      Keywords: upcharge, horrible, disaster, cancelled, contaminated, etc.
      
   2. context_aware_positive → POSITIVE
      Detects when negative words are about OTHER brands
      Example: "Don't switch from HF to Marley Spoon - MS is terrible!"
      
   3. is_question OR has_neutral_comparison → NEUTRAL
      Keywords: what, which, switching to, recommendations, anyone tried
      
   4. has_strong_positive → POSITIVE
      Keywords: love, amazing, excellent, highly recommend
      
   5. VADER + TextBlob combined → positive/negative/neutral
      Fallback for posts without strong keywords

2. NEUTRAL COMPARISON KEYWORDS (lines 662-671):
   - switching to, switch to, switching from
   - which is better, better than, trying to decide
   - what service, which service, what meal kit
   - recommendation, anyone know, anyone tried
   - looking for, trying to find, best meal service

3. STRONG NEGATIVE KEYWORDS (lines 673-684):
   - stay away, avoid, terrible, worst, horrible, awful
   - disgusting, rotten, spoiled, cancelled, cancel
   - scam, fraud, disappointed, never again
   - upcharge, overpriced, rip off, complaint
   - missing, wrong, damaged, late delivery
   - disaster, gross, contaminated, ruined, laughable

4. CONTEXT-AWARE POSITIVE DETECTION (lines 704-756):
   
   Logic:
   a) Finds negative words in text
   b) Checks if they're within 50 chars of OTHER brand names
   c) Looks for primary brand mentioned with positive context
   d) Positive indicators: better, resolved, fairly, always
   e) Flips sentiment from negative to positive
   
   Example Detection:
   Text: "I switched to Marley Spoon. What a disaster! 
          This makes HF look better than I once thought."
   Result: POSITIVE for HelloFresh (negative words about Marley Spoon)

5. PRIMARY BRAND DETECTION (lines 518-640):
   
   Ensures posts are CUSTOMER DISCUSSIONS, not just mentions.
   
   Requirements:
   - Brand name present in text
   - At least one customer discussion phrase (60+ phrases)
   
   Customer Discussion Phrases Include:
   - Questions: has anyone, anyone tried, recommendations
   - Experience: i tried, i use, my box, my order
   - Opinions: love, hate, quality, taste, fresh
   - Issues: customer service, cancel, refund, complaint
   - Comparisons: better than, worse than, vs, switch
   - Recipes: recipe, meal, dish, cooked, made this
   
   Returns: Brand name OR None (if not customer discussion)
