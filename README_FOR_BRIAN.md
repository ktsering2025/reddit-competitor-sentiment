## 5. GITHUB HANDOFF OPTIONS {#github-handoff}

To take over this project, you need access to the GitHub repository. There are **two options**:

---

### **OPTION 1: TRANSFER FULL OWNERSHIP (Recommended)**

**What This Means:**
- You become the owner of the repository
- Repository moves to your GitHub account
- You have complete control (settings, secrets, actions, etc.)
- All automation continues to work
- Website URL changes to: `https://your-username.github.io/reddit-competitor-sentiment/`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control and ownership
- ✅ Can delete, transfer, or modify anything
- ✅ Clean handoff (you're the owner)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Website URL changes (need to update bookmarks)
- ⚠️ Need to re-enable GitHub Pages (takes 2 minutes)

---

### **OPTION 2: ADD YOU AS ADMIN (Keep Kunsang as Owner)**

**What This Means:**
- Kunsang remains the owner
- You get admin access (can do almost everything)
- Repository stays at: `ktsering2025/reddit-competitor-sentiment`
- Website URL stays the same
- You can manage settings, secrets, actions

**Pros:**
- ✅ Website URL stays the same
- ✅ No setup needed (works immediately)
- ✅ Kunsang can help if needed

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Can't transfer or delete repository
- ⚠️ Kunsang remains owner (but you have admin rights)

---

### **Comparison Table:**

| Feature | Transfer Ownership | Add as Admin |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **You control everything** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Almost (can't delete repo) |
| **Can manage secrets** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Can manage GitHub Actions** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Can add/remove recipients** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Can manually trigger runs** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Website URL** | Changes | Stays same |
| **Setup needed** | 5 minutes | 0 minutes |
| **Recommended for** | Long-term ownership | Quick handoff |

---

### **My Recommendation:**

**Choose Option 1 (Transfer Ownership)** if:
- You want full control and ownership
- You're okay with website URL changing
- This is a long-term handoff

**Choose Option 2 (Add as Admin)** if:
- You want quick access with minimal setup
- You want website URL to stay the same
- You're okay with Kunsang remaining owner
