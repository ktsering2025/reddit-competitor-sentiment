## 🚀 30-Second Version

"I built an automated Reddit sentiment analysis tool that tracks 8 meal kit 
competitors. Every Sunday at 8 PM, it scrapes Reddit, analyzes sentiment, 
generates reports, and emails 5 stakeholders with insights. It's been running 
successfully for a month using GitHub Actions, but I want to make sure my 
automation approach is production-ready. Do you have 15 minutes to chat about 
best practices?"

Hey [Name]! 👋

Quick question: I built a Reddit sentiment analysis tool that automatically 
emails weekly reports to 5 stakeholders. It's working great (using GitHub 
Actions), but I want to make sure my automation approach is production-ready.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to chat about best practices? Happy to 
show you what I built!
