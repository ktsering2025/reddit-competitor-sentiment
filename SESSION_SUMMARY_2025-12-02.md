### 2. How to Ask ML/AI Team

**Quick Answer:** Copy this message and send via Slack:

```
Hey [Name]! 👋

Quick question: I built a Reddit sentiment analysis tool that automatically 
emails weekly reports to 5 stakeholders every Sunday. It's been working great 
for the past month, but I want to make sure my automation approach is 
production-ready.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to chat about best practices?

My question: Is GitHub Actions cron reliable enough for production, or should 
I be using something else?

Dashboard: https://ktsering2025.github.io/reddit-competitor-sentiment/
```

**Key Point:** You're not asking for help because it's broken. You're asking to validate your approach and learn best practices. That's what good engineers do!
