## 📱 OPTION 1: Slack/Teams Message (Copy This)

```
Hey [Name]! 👋

Quick question: I built a Reddit sentiment analysis tool that automatically 
emails weekly reports to 5 stakeholders every Sunday. It's been working great 
for the past month, but I want to make sure my automation approach is 
production-ready.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to chat about best practices?

What I built:
• Scrapes Reddit for 8 meal kit brands
• Analyzes sentiment (VADER + TextBlob)
• Generates charts and reports
• Emails stakeholders automatically
• Live dashboard: https://ktsering2025.github.io/reddit-competitor-sentiment/

My question: Is GitHub Actions cron reliable enough for production, or should 
I be using something else?

Let me know if you have time!
```

## 📧 OPTION 2: Email (Copy This)

**Subject:** `Quick Question: Weekly Automation Best Practices`

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I'm working on a Reddit competitor sentiment analysis 
project and would love your input on automation best practices.

What I've Built:
- Weekly sentiment analysis for 8 meal kit brands
- Automated reports emailed to 5 stakeholders every Sunday
- All components working (scraping, analysis, reporting, email delivery)
- Running successfully for 4+ weeks via GitHub Actions

My Question:
Is GitHub Actions cron reliable enough for production weekly automation, or 
should I consider alternatives? I want to ensure 100% reliability.

Would you have 15-20 minutes this week to chat? I can show you what I've 
built and get your thoughts.
